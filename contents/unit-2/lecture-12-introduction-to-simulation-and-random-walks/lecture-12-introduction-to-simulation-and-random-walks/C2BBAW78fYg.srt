9
00:00:21,271 --> 00:00:24,270
PROFESSOR: OK.

10
00:00:24,270 --> 00:00:27,820
You can probably figure out,
I'm not Professor Guttag.

11
00:00:27,820 --> 00:00:28,850
He's away today.

12
00:00:28,850 --> 00:00:30,860
And so he's asked me to cover
this lecture, which

13
00:00:30,860 --> 00:00:32,530
I'm happy to do.

14
00:00:32,530 --> 00:00:35,150
I'm asked to remind you
that there is no

15
00:00:35,150 --> 00:00:37,860
recitation on Friday.

16
00:00:37,860 --> 00:00:40,440
I was expecting at least a
smile or a small cheer.

17
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:41,420
Early lead into spring break.

18
00:00:41,420 --> 00:00:43,870
This ought to be good.

19
00:00:43,870 --> 00:00:46,660
So my understanding is that
at the end of last class,

20
00:00:46,660 --> 00:00:50,480
Professor Guttag was walking you
through a set of classes.

21
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:52,250
And I want to remind you
of where you were.

22
00:00:52,250 --> 00:00:54,710
I want to look at one of those
classes in a bit more detail,

23
00:00:54,710 --> 00:00:55,820
because we're going to
show you one new

24
00:00:55,820 --> 00:00:57,410
piece of the language.

25
00:00:57,410 --> 00:00:59,800
And then we're going to turn to
a different topic, which is

26
00:00:59,800 --> 00:01:02,640
going to be the subject for
the next several lectures.

27
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:05,850
So just to remind you where
you were, Professor Guttag

28
00:01:05,850 --> 00:01:07,910
showed you a set of classes
which started off with a

29
00:01:07,910 --> 00:01:09,580
person class.

30
00:01:09,580 --> 00:01:14,210
There's a definition I'll
put up on the screen.

31
00:01:14,210 --> 00:01:17,060
This was just something that
created a kind of object.

32
00:01:17,060 --> 00:01:18,560
I'm not going to go through the
details, but you had the

33
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:19,830
standard things you'd expect.

34
00:01:19,830 --> 00:01:21,740
You had a way of initializing
it.

35
00:01:21,740 --> 00:01:22,960
So you'd make each instance.

36
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:25,155
And it had a way of pulling
out the name, so you could

37
00:01:25,155 --> 00:01:27,620
have a full name and
a last name.

38
00:01:27,620 --> 00:01:30,580
You could get out pieces of it,
it set birthday, it had

39
00:01:30,580 --> 00:01:32,470
age, it had a bunch of stuff.

40
00:01:32,470 --> 00:01:33,665
And that's fine.

41
00:01:33,665 --> 00:01:38,310
The second thing that he did
that we do in a lot of dealing

42
00:01:38,310 --> 00:01:41,850
with classes is he created
specialization of that, a

43
00:01:41,850 --> 00:01:43,100
thing called an MIT person.

44
00:01:43,100 --> 00:01:50,130

45
00:01:50,130 --> 00:01:52,880
And you all know that
MIT people are

46
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:55,750
special people, right?

47
00:01:55,750 --> 00:01:57,520
And what did an MIT person do?

48
00:01:57,520 --> 00:01:59,110
Well, again, you
can look at it.

49
00:01:59,110 --> 00:02:02,190
It had, again, an init method.

50
00:02:02,190 --> 00:02:04,120
But one of the things that was
a little different here-- you

51
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:06,030
may have seen it in some other
places-- is that we can

52
00:02:06,030 --> 00:02:07,920
create, inside of that class

53
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:10,580
definition, an internal variable.

54
00:02:10,580 --> 00:02:13,430
In this case, it was
the ID number.

55
00:02:13,430 --> 00:02:17,120
So that every time we created an
instance of this class, we

56
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:18,840
could give that instance
a special number

57
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:19,610
and a unique number.

58
00:02:19,610 --> 00:02:21,740
And that was exactly what
we did here, right?

59
00:02:21,740 --> 00:02:24,030
If you're going to create one
of these things, you set the

60
00:02:24,030 --> 00:02:29,800
ID number to be the
next number.

61
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:31,840
And then you would increment
that, so that you'd be able

62
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:33,310
to, next time you created
an instance,

63
00:02:33,310 --> 00:02:34,620
give it a unique number.

64
00:02:34,620 --> 00:02:37,590
And that let you do things like
put things out in order,

65
00:02:37,590 --> 00:02:39,830
and things of that sort.

66
00:02:39,830 --> 00:02:41,690
There was also a method in this
class that we're going to

67
00:02:41,690 --> 00:02:44,360
use in a second, which is
something that would say, is

68
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:46,210
this person a student?

69
00:02:46,210 --> 00:02:48,780
I'll just highlight for you
there the definition of it,

70
00:02:48,780 --> 00:02:52,730
which said you'd look at the
type of the instance and say,

71
00:02:52,730 --> 00:02:54,850
is it undergrad or grad?

72
00:02:54,850 --> 00:02:58,670
And that was the other two
specializations we had here.

73
00:02:58,670 --> 00:03:06,580
We had undergraduates and
we had graduates.

74
00:03:06,580 --> 00:03:08,020
And again, I'm not going to
worry about the details.

75
00:03:08,020 --> 00:03:08,950
You saw this last time.

76
00:03:08,950 --> 00:03:11,640
Undergrads, they have some
methods like you could create

77
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:13,090
an instance of it -- you'd
have its year.

78
00:03:13,090 --> 00:03:15,330
You could give back
what the year was.

79
00:03:15,330 --> 00:03:17,440
And for the graduate students,
we didn't even bother with

80
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:18,120
putting details in.

81
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:21,350
It could be anything you want.

82
00:03:21,350 --> 00:03:23,270
Now these are things that you
ought to be getting used to

83
00:03:23,270 --> 00:03:23,700
looking at.

84
00:03:23,700 --> 00:03:25,610
So this is creating some
class definitions.

85
00:03:25,610 --> 00:03:26,820
I can make some instances.

86
00:03:26,820 --> 00:03:29,945
There are a couple of nice
variations like, for the MIT

87
00:03:29,945 --> 00:03:32,790
people, each one has a unique
identifier, which lets us keep

88
00:03:32,790 --> 00:03:34,390
track of them.

89
00:03:34,390 --> 00:03:36,650
I think where Professor Guttag
ended up last time was

90
00:03:36,650 --> 00:03:39,810
actually creating
a course list.

91
00:03:39,810 --> 00:03:43,670
So a list of students in
a class, like 6.00.

92
00:03:43,670 --> 00:03:45,700
So I want to show you that, and
I want to show you some

93
00:03:45,700 --> 00:03:46,590
highlights of that.

94
00:03:46,590 --> 00:03:48,830
So there's the definition.

95
00:03:48,830 --> 00:03:51,620
It's on your handout as well.

96
00:03:51,620 --> 00:03:52,900
So what does a course list do?

97
00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:55,430

98
00:03:55,430 --> 00:03:57,490
Well, the idea should be, it's
a way of collecting together

99
00:03:57,490 --> 00:03:59,370
all the students in 6.00.

100
00:03:59,370 --> 00:04:03,910
So if you look at our init
function up here, when we

101
00:04:03,910 --> 00:04:07,320
create an instance of a course
list, what does it do?

102
00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:09,960
Well, we give it a number,
like 6.00.

103
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:12,260
And it's going to bind that
locally inside of a

104
00:04:12,260 --> 00:04:12,820
definition.

105
00:04:12,820 --> 00:04:17,230
And it's going to create
a collection, a list.

106
00:04:17,230 --> 00:04:19,899
It's going to be a list
of all the students.

107
00:04:19,899 --> 00:04:22,070
Now if I'm going to do that, I
need to have a way of putting

108
00:04:22,070 --> 00:04:23,230
students into the class.

109
00:04:23,230 --> 00:04:26,110
And I know nobody drops 6.00,
but just in case-- drop date's

110
00:04:26,110 --> 00:04:28,630
coming up-- we have to have some
way of removing a student

111
00:04:28,630 --> 00:04:29,820
from a class.

112
00:04:29,820 --> 00:04:33,450
So I'm going to have a
method right here--

113
00:04:33,450 --> 00:04:35,080
oops, sorry, I'm going to
get it from the right

114
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:37,120
place, right there--

115
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:40,210
that would add a student in.

116
00:04:40,210 --> 00:04:43,210
Now take a look at that
for a second.

117
00:04:43,210 --> 00:04:46,760
It's not just putting the
student into the list.

118
00:04:46,760 --> 00:04:48,880
The very bottom down here,
that last line,

119
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:50,960
self.students.append().

120
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:51,710
What's that doing?

121
00:04:51,710 --> 00:04:54,400
Well, self, remember, refers
to the instance.

122
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:57,990
.students will get me that
list for that instance.

123
00:04:57,990 --> 00:05:01,030
And then .append says, add on
to the end of that list the

124
00:05:01,030 --> 00:05:03,380
person that I just added
in, the person

125
00:05:03,380 --> 00:05:05,390
that is bound to who.

126
00:05:05,390 --> 00:05:07,940
The things above it
are being careful.

127
00:05:07,940 --> 00:05:09,690
They're defensive programming.

128
00:05:09,690 --> 00:05:13,330
They're ways of saying, look,
make sure that the person is

129
00:05:13,330 --> 00:05:15,172
actually a student.

130
00:05:15,172 --> 00:05:15,660
Huh.

131
00:05:15,660 --> 00:05:18,120
Wait a minute, where'd
that come from?

132
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:19,770
isStudent.

133
00:05:19,770 --> 00:05:24,280
Oh, yeah, that was up
here in MIT person.

134
00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:26,680
So we're making an assumption
here that says, we're only

135
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:27,520
adding in students.

136
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:29,840
No post-docs are welcome.

137
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:31,100
We're going to only
add in students.

138
00:05:31,100 --> 00:05:33,680
So we're taking instances of one
of these two classes, and

139
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:36,750
checking using the inherited
method to make sure that this

140
00:05:36,750 --> 00:05:38,430
person is actually a student.

141
00:05:38,430 --> 00:05:40,150
And we're doing this in a
careful way, which is we're

142
00:05:40,150 --> 00:05:43,570
going to raise an error if, in
fact, it's not a student.

143
00:05:43,570 --> 00:05:45,320
And then the second thing,
notice, that we're going to do

144
00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:46,870
here is we're going to say, gee,
make sure that we're not

145
00:05:46,870 --> 00:05:48,590
adding you twice.

146
00:05:48,590 --> 00:05:49,730
So we're going to do what?

147
00:05:49,730 --> 00:05:51,880
We're going to say, get
out the list of

148
00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:55,270
students right there.

149
00:05:55,270 --> 00:05:56,160
and I begin.

150
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:58,930
self is pointing to the
instance.students gives me the

151
00:05:58,930 --> 00:06:00,550
list of students currently
in that instance.

152
00:06:00,550 --> 00:06:04,580
And I'm basically saying, is
this person in that list?

153
00:06:04,580 --> 00:06:06,410
And if they are, again, I'm
going to raise an error

154
00:06:06,410 --> 00:06:08,990
saying, wait a minute, you're
already in the class.

155
00:06:08,990 --> 00:06:11,120
So these are things I'm sure
you've seen before.

156
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:12,820
But they're ways of being a
little careful about the

157
00:06:12,820 --> 00:06:14,080
programming.

158
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:15,940
The removeStudent is
roughly the same.

159
00:06:15,940 --> 00:06:18,690
So let's just look at
some examples here.

160
00:06:18,690 --> 00:06:21,680
I've created a set of people.

161
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:25,100
And just to show you what they
look like, let's go down here.

162
00:06:25,100 --> 00:06:26,350
So I've created m1.

163
00:06:26,350 --> 00:06:29,170

164
00:06:29,170 --> 00:06:31,470
Let me do that again,
sorry about that.

165
00:06:31,470 --> 00:06:33,406
I'm going to run this.

166
00:06:33,406 --> 00:06:34,210
All right.

167
00:06:34,210 --> 00:06:35,520
So if I look at m1--

168
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:39,560

169
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:40,620
it's not liking me, is it?

170
00:06:40,620 --> 00:06:41,830
We'll try it one more time.

171
00:06:41,830 --> 00:06:44,250
I'm going to look at m1.

172
00:06:44,250 --> 00:06:47,650
It gives me back an instance
of an object.

173
00:06:47,650 --> 00:06:48,230
[UNINTELLIGIBLE]

174
00:06:48,230 --> 00:06:54,140
if I actually say a print of m1,
it'll print out the name.

175
00:06:54,140 --> 00:06:55,740
And the same thing for the
undergraduates here.

176
00:06:55,740 --> 00:06:57,490
So I've made a couple of
undergraduates, I've made a

177
00:06:57,490 --> 00:06:58,750
couple of graduate students.

178
00:06:58,750 --> 00:07:00,400
And notice what I've
done down here.

179
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:05,910
I've created a course,
SixHundred, by calling

180
00:07:05,910 --> 00:07:06,350
CourseList.

181
00:07:06,350 --> 00:07:08,380
So CourseList is going to make
an instance of that.

182
00:07:08,380 --> 00:07:09,630
I gave it the name.

183
00:07:09,630 --> 00:07:10,640
So we can go back over here.

184
00:07:10,640 --> 00:07:12,055
Let's look at what
SixHundred says.

185
00:07:12,055 --> 00:07:16,010

186
00:07:16,010 --> 00:07:17,245
OK.

187
00:07:17,245 --> 00:07:19,200
I'm sure you're used to reading
that gobbledygook.

188
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:23,070
It says, ah, it's an instance,
and it's an instance of a

189
00:07:23,070 --> 00:07:24,170
CourseList.

190
00:07:24,170 --> 00:07:26,960
And it gives me a pointer
to where it is.

191
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:32,550
Now what if I want to see the
students inside this course?

192
00:07:32,550 --> 00:07:35,510
I'd like to see, who are
all the students there?

193
00:07:35,510 --> 00:07:38,045
So printing SixHundred--

194
00:07:38,045 --> 00:07:39,860
let's see if that does
the right thing.

195
00:07:39,860 --> 00:07:42,390

196
00:07:42,390 --> 00:07:43,960
Oops, no.

197
00:07:43,960 --> 00:07:44,930
That kind of makes
sense, right?

198
00:07:44,930 --> 00:07:46,390
SixHundred is just pointing
to an instance.

199
00:07:46,390 --> 00:07:48,110
So where are the students?

200
00:07:48,110 --> 00:07:51,960
They're sitting down inside of
an internal variable, which

201
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:53,940
is, in fact, in this case,
the list of students.

202
00:07:53,940 --> 00:08:02,690
So one way I could do this is I
could say, take SixHundred,

203
00:08:02,690 --> 00:08:05,950
which is an instance, and
go into that frame that

204
00:08:05,950 --> 00:08:08,250
corresponds to that
and look up the

205
00:08:08,250 --> 00:08:10,050
local variable, students.

206
00:08:10,050 --> 00:08:13,670
And if I do that, oh,
I've got a bunch of

207
00:08:13,670 --> 00:08:16,790
students named Main.

208
00:08:16,790 --> 00:08:18,320
Now this shouldn't surprise
you, right?

209
00:08:18,320 --> 00:08:19,110
This is doing what?

210
00:08:19,110 --> 00:08:22,540
It's giving me back that
instance of the list.

211
00:08:22,540 --> 00:08:25,190
If I actually want to print out
the names of the students,

212
00:08:25,190 --> 00:08:26,920
I have to do something a
little more careful.

213
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:28,870
So here's one way
I could do it.

214
00:08:28,870 --> 00:08:39,047
I could say, for every student
in that list, let's print out

215
00:08:39,047 --> 00:08:40,297
their name.

216
00:08:40,297 --> 00:08:42,179

217
00:08:42,179 --> 00:08:43,429
Oh, good.

218
00:08:43,429 --> 00:08:45,890

219
00:08:45,890 --> 00:08:47,300
You're wondering, why
am I doing this?

220
00:08:47,300 --> 00:08:49,050
Well, I want to show you what's
going on in this class.

221
00:08:49,050 --> 00:08:51,100
And then I want to highlight
something for you.

222
00:08:51,100 --> 00:08:52,175
So let's think about
what I just said.

223
00:08:52,175 --> 00:08:55,130
I want to get the names of all
the students in the class.

224
00:08:55,130 --> 00:08:58,350
So I took the instance, I went
in and pulled out an internal

225
00:08:58,350 --> 00:09:01,020
variable, and then I did a for
loop that walked along it,

226
00:09:01,020 --> 00:09:02,190
printing those out.

227
00:09:02,190 --> 00:09:04,810
Is that a good idea?

228
00:09:04,810 --> 00:09:07,770
Is that a not-so-good idea?

229
00:09:07,770 --> 00:09:10,590
Is that a really bad idea?

230
00:09:10,590 --> 00:09:12,990
Don't you hate professors who
ask questions at 10 o'clock in

231
00:09:12,990 --> 00:09:14,840
the morning?

232
00:09:14,840 --> 00:09:17,710
Well, I'm going to suggest that
it's not a great idea.

233
00:09:17,710 --> 00:09:19,490
And here's why.

234
00:09:19,490 --> 00:09:23,870
I'm reaching into an instance
and pulling out an internal

235
00:09:23,870 --> 00:09:26,715
variable and doing something
with it.

236
00:09:26,715 --> 00:09:29,980
A much cleaner way of dealing
with that is to build an

237
00:09:29,980 --> 00:09:32,925
interface, to build a function,
a method, that

238
00:09:32,925 --> 00:09:35,410
belongs to that instance,
that would give me back

239
00:09:35,410 --> 00:09:37,110
the pieces I want.

240
00:09:37,110 --> 00:09:39,500
And the reason I'd like that is
then I don't have to worry

241
00:09:39,500 --> 00:09:42,500
about, if I change my mind in
terms of how I represent

242
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:44,970
things internally, all I have
to do is think about that

243
00:09:44,970 --> 00:09:45,585
interface function.

244
00:09:45,585 --> 00:09:47,630
Right

245
00:09:47,630 --> 00:09:49,730
So the last thing I want to show
you here in this example

246
00:09:49,730 --> 00:09:52,960
is let's look, in fact,
right here.

247
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:57,130
I've added a method called
allStudents.

248
00:09:57,130 --> 00:09:58,960
But it's a little different,
I think, than things you've

249
00:09:58,960 --> 00:10:01,120
probably seen before.

250
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:01,740
So what's the idea?

251
00:10:01,740 --> 00:10:03,420
I want allStudents.

252
00:10:03,420 --> 00:10:04,650
To be a function, or a method.

253
00:10:04,650 --> 00:10:06,350
When I call that, I
want it to give me

254
00:10:06,350 --> 00:10:09,730
back all of the students.

255
00:10:09,730 --> 00:10:12,210
Now, I could have had it just
give me back the list, but I

256
00:10:12,210 --> 00:10:15,730
might want to have the method
give me back not just all the

257
00:10:15,730 --> 00:10:17,520
students, but maybe some
students, like only the

258
00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:19,690
undergraduates in the class.

259
00:10:19,690 --> 00:10:22,490
And in fact, right below
there, I've got a

260
00:10:22,490 --> 00:10:25,100
method that does that.

261
00:10:25,100 --> 00:10:25,770
Let's look at this one.

262
00:10:25,770 --> 00:10:27,040
It says, I want to get back the

263
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:29,010
undergraduates in the class.

264
00:10:29,010 --> 00:10:30,340
And what's it do?

265
00:10:30,340 --> 00:10:31,560
It's going to do a
little counting.

266
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:33,880
It's going to set index to 0.

267
00:10:33,880 --> 00:10:35,830
And then it's going to run
through a while loop where it

268
00:10:35,830 --> 00:10:40,910
basically takes each student
and checks its type.

269
00:10:40,910 --> 00:10:43,575
This is something you've seen
before, taking a loop and

270
00:10:43,575 --> 00:10:46,120
walking along, taking each
element of that list and

271
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:47,760
saying, if it's an
undergraduate, I'm going to

272
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:50,360
give you back that student, and
I'm incrementing index at

273
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:52,830
the bottom.

274
00:10:52,830 --> 00:10:54,680
Here's the funky thing.

275
00:10:54,680 --> 00:10:56,940
I've used a word called yield.

276
00:10:56,940 --> 00:10:59,640
And that's different than
you've seen before.

277
00:10:59,640 --> 00:11:02,160
I'm not directly accumulating
a list.

278
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:04,550
You don't see anywhere where I'm
building up a list here.

279
00:11:04,550 --> 00:11:09,630
So yield is an example of a form
that you're going to want

280
00:11:09,630 --> 00:11:15,630
to use called a generator.

281
00:11:15,630 --> 00:11:20,780

282
00:11:20,780 --> 00:11:26,560
Now a generator is a little bit
like a return, but with

283
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:27,410
one big exception.

284
00:11:27,410 --> 00:11:30,520
If I had a return in that method
somewhere, when it

285
00:11:30,520 --> 00:11:32,200
found the first thing, it's
going to give me back the

286
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:33,710
value and it's done.

287
00:11:33,710 --> 00:11:36,080
And so any information it stored
about where it was in

288
00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:37,225
that computation--

289
00:11:37,225 --> 00:11:40,680
the phrase we use is it gets
popped off the stack frame.

290
00:11:40,680 --> 00:11:42,040
Yield is a little different.

291
00:11:42,040 --> 00:11:44,415
And it's different because
a generator--

292
00:11:44,415 --> 00:11:46,620
I'm going to write this
down carefully.

293
00:11:46,620 --> 00:11:59,180
A generator is a function that
remembers the point in the

294
00:11:59,180 --> 00:12:01,280
body where it was.

295
00:12:01,280 --> 00:12:06,417

296
00:12:06,417 --> 00:12:10,460
It remembers the point in the
function body where it last

297
00:12:10,460 --> 00:12:22,410
returned, plus all the
local variables.

298
00:12:22,410 --> 00:12:27,450

299
00:12:27,450 --> 00:12:29,220
So what does this mean?

300
00:12:29,220 --> 00:12:33,240
It says, it's going to keep
track of what was the state

301
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:36,720
when I did the computation, so
that if I call it a second

302
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:40,100
time, it goes right back to that
state and continues the

303
00:12:40,100 --> 00:12:40,740
computation.

304
00:12:40,740 --> 00:12:42,860
If I called it a third time,
it goes right back to that

305
00:12:42,860 --> 00:12:45,430
state and gives you a
continuation on the

306
00:12:45,430 --> 00:12:46,840
computation.

307
00:12:46,840 --> 00:12:50,000
So in fact, what yield does,
what a generator does, is what

308
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,650
you would do what you normally
walk through a list.

309
00:12:52,650 --> 00:12:54,660
But it gives you some control.

310
00:12:54,660 --> 00:12:57,940
So it gives you a way of
actually deciding, how do I

311
00:12:57,940 --> 00:13:02,160
want to create something I
could use in a for list.

312
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:04,580
And if we go back and
look at it, you can

313
00:13:04,580 --> 00:13:05,830
see it right there.

314
00:13:05,830 --> 00:13:08,260

315
00:13:08,260 --> 00:13:12,300
The method definition for
UGs, undergraduates--

316
00:13:12,300 --> 00:13:16,510
if I call it, it is basically
going to walk through, one at

317
00:13:16,510 --> 00:13:20,110
a time, each element in the
underlying representation and

318
00:13:20,110 --> 00:13:22,280
generate for me the next
element of the

319
00:13:22,280 --> 00:13:24,070
thing I want to use.

320
00:13:24,070 --> 00:13:25,910
So let me show you a couple
of examples of using it.

321
00:13:25,910 --> 00:13:28,550
In this case, I've buried inside
of a for or a while

322
00:13:28,550 --> 00:13:33,360
loop, but if I go over here, I
should be able to do things

323
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:38,725
like, are all the students
in SixHundred?

324
00:13:38,725 --> 00:13:44,550

325
00:13:44,550 --> 00:13:46,010
And notice the open/close
paren,

326
00:13:46,010 --> 00:13:46,800
because that's a method.

327
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:48,050
I need to call it.

328
00:13:48,050 --> 00:13:53,190

329
00:13:53,190 --> 00:13:54,510
Now you're going, whoop-de-do.

330
00:13:54,510 --> 00:13:56,570
That's just like the print
thing I did before.

331
00:13:56,570 --> 00:13:59,320
But the difference here is I'm
controlling now how I get

332
00:13:59,320 --> 00:14:00,480
access to those.

333
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:02,290
And to show you just a slightly
different way of

334
00:14:02,290 --> 00:14:05,290
doing this, I could now do
things like say the following.

335
00:14:05,290 --> 00:14:15,060
For all the students in
SixHundred, and I'm going to

336
00:14:15,060 --> 00:14:17,460
take all the students
again in SixHundred.

337
00:14:17,460 --> 00:14:22,290

338
00:14:22,290 --> 00:14:24,730
So notice what I'm
doing, two loops.

339
00:14:24,730 --> 00:14:27,130
And I'm going to create
something that basically keeps

340
00:14:27,130 --> 00:14:30,030
track of where I am in each one
of those loops using that

341
00:14:30,030 --> 00:14:31,280
yield function.

342
00:14:31,280 --> 00:14:37,270

343
00:14:37,270 --> 00:14:39,212
So take a look at what
it printed out.

344
00:14:39,212 --> 00:14:42,690
That outer loop is using the
generator to generate each

345
00:14:42,690 --> 00:14:43,610
element of the list.

346
00:14:43,610 --> 00:14:46,940
It hangs onto that, so that
the inner loop can walk

347
00:14:46,940 --> 00:14:49,020
through again, a generator
going through each

348
00:14:49,020 --> 00:14:50,510
element of that list.

349
00:14:50,510 --> 00:14:52,660
And I'm printing out
students squared --

350
00:14:52,660 --> 00:14:54,820
first student times all other
students, second student times

351
00:14:54,820 --> 00:14:56,080
all other students,
third student

352
00:14:56,080 --> 00:14:58,050
times all other students.

353
00:14:58,050 --> 00:15:00,870
And of course the other
thing I can do is I

354
00:15:00,870 --> 00:15:03,670
can do the same thing--

355
00:15:03,670 --> 00:15:09,300
sorry about that-- for s in
SixHundred undergrads.

356
00:15:09,300 --> 00:15:14,760

357
00:15:14,760 --> 00:15:16,970
And in this case, it's walking
through that internal

358
00:15:16,970 --> 00:15:20,310
representation, generating each
element that satisfies

359
00:15:20,310 --> 00:15:21,560
the constraints.

360
00:15:21,560 --> 00:15:23,560

361
00:15:23,560 --> 00:15:25,590
OK.

362
00:15:25,590 --> 00:15:27,590
It's a little esoteric,
but you're going to

363
00:15:27,590 --> 00:15:29,500
find it really useful.

364
00:15:29,500 --> 00:15:31,330
And it's the last piece, I
think, of syntax you're going

365
00:15:31,330 --> 00:15:34,360
to see for a while in terms
of the language.

366
00:15:34,360 --> 00:15:35,800
You could do this by just

367
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:38,060
manipulating the list directly.

368
00:15:38,060 --> 00:15:40,580
But the idea of a generator
you're going to find really

369
00:15:40,580 --> 00:15:43,680
useful when you want to
control access to a

370
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:44,930
collection.

371
00:15:44,930 --> 00:15:49,410
Really think of the generator as
something that keeps track

372
00:15:49,410 --> 00:15:52,040
of the state of the computation,
so it can go back

373
00:15:52,040 --> 00:15:55,540
and pick it up whenever
it needs it.

374
00:15:55,540 --> 00:15:57,090
OK.

375
00:15:57,090 --> 00:15:58,830
That wraps up that
piece of what

376
00:15:58,830 --> 00:16:00,240
Professor Guttag was doing.

377
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:04,520
So I want to now switch to a
completely different topic,

378
00:16:04,520 --> 00:16:06,210
which we're going to do today,
we're going to do Thursday,

379
00:16:06,210 --> 00:16:09,990
and it may well carry into
after spring break.

380
00:16:09,990 --> 00:16:13,440
The second topic deals with,
how do we go about building

381
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:18,530
computational models to
solve real problems.

382
00:16:18,530 --> 00:16:20,995
And I want to start by putting
up here a comparison.

383
00:16:20,995 --> 00:16:23,790

384
00:16:23,790 --> 00:16:33,570
For much of the history of
science, people focused on

385
00:16:33,570 --> 00:16:36,720
trying to find analytic
methods.

386
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:39,060
Big word, what does it mean?

387
00:16:39,060 --> 00:16:41,860
Well, an analytic model is
something that lets you

388
00:16:41,860 --> 00:16:46,050
precisely predict the behavior
of a system, just based on

389
00:16:46,050 --> 00:16:49,420
some initial conditions and
a set of parameters.

390
00:16:49,420 --> 00:16:53,600
So this is a mathematical
function, if you like.

391
00:16:53,600 --> 00:17:07,760
You can predict behavior given
some initial conditions and

392
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:09,010
some parameters.

393
00:17:09,010 --> 00:17:13,390

394
00:17:13,390 --> 00:17:16,599
Newtonian physics, 8.01--

395
00:17:16,599 --> 00:17:17,980
analytic models.

396
00:17:17,980 --> 00:17:19,579
Spring constants--
analytic models.

397
00:17:19,579 --> 00:17:20,880
They're things that let
you predict what a

398
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:24,170
system's going to do.

399
00:17:24,170 --> 00:17:26,859
For, I don't know, several
centuries, this was basically

400
00:17:26,859 --> 00:17:27,640
what science did.

401
00:17:27,640 --> 00:17:28,510
It was really useful.

402
00:17:28,510 --> 00:17:31,960
It lead to things like calculus
and to things like

403
00:17:31,960 --> 00:17:33,710
probability theory.

404
00:17:33,710 --> 00:17:39,540
It lead to basically
understanding the macroscopic

405
00:17:39,540 --> 00:17:40,370
physical world.

406
00:17:40,370 --> 00:17:43,720
So it's the stuff you
saw in high school.

407
00:17:43,720 --> 00:17:44,970
That's nice.

408
00:17:44,970 --> 00:17:48,030
But it doesn't always work.

409
00:17:48,030 --> 00:17:51,090
And indeed, as the 20th century
progressed, one of the

410
00:17:51,090 --> 00:17:54,860
things we saw was that there are
places where this doesn't

411
00:17:54,860 --> 00:18:01,750
really satisfy what you need,
and you're better off with

412
00:18:01,750 --> 00:18:06,190
simulation methods, which
is what we're going

413
00:18:06,190 --> 00:18:07,020
to talk about here.

414
00:18:07,020 --> 00:18:08,460
So what do I mean by
simulation methods?

415
00:18:08,460 --> 00:18:10,420
First of all, let me talk about
why do we want to get a

416
00:18:10,420 --> 00:18:11,260
simulation method.

417
00:18:11,260 --> 00:18:13,930
The idea was that there are
going to be some places where

418
00:18:13,930 --> 00:18:15,610
it's really hard to
build a model.

419
00:18:15,610 --> 00:18:17,850
So in fact, places where
this comes up--

420
00:18:17,850 --> 00:18:22,950

421
00:18:22,950 --> 00:18:24,890
sometimes we have systems
that are not

422
00:18:24,890 --> 00:18:26,140
mathematically tractable.

423
00:18:26,140 --> 00:18:34,120

424
00:18:34,120 --> 00:18:35,180
Again, a highfalutin word.

425
00:18:35,180 --> 00:18:35,650
What does it mean?

426
00:18:35,650 --> 00:18:37,620
It says, there are some systems
where it's really hard

427
00:18:37,620 --> 00:18:40,810
to build a physical model
that exactly predicts

428
00:18:40,810 --> 00:18:42,370
what's going to happen.

429
00:18:42,370 --> 00:18:45,130
Think weather forecasting.

430
00:18:45,130 --> 00:18:45,810
It doesn't work well.

431
00:18:45,810 --> 00:18:47,050
Actually, in Boston,
it's easy.

432
00:18:47,050 --> 00:18:48,690
Just assume it's going to
snow, and you're fine.

433
00:18:48,690 --> 00:18:51,522

434
00:18:51,522 --> 00:18:51,800
All right.

435
00:18:51,800 --> 00:18:53,020
That's one reason why
we want to move

436
00:18:53,020 --> 00:18:53,960
towards simulation models.

437
00:18:53,960 --> 00:18:55,600
Here's a second reason why
we'd like to move towards

438
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:56,320
simulation models.

439
00:18:56,320 --> 00:18:59,540
There's times when, in fact,
as things get more complex,

440
00:18:59,540 --> 00:19:08,870
we're better off just
successively refining a series

441
00:19:08,870 --> 00:19:10,120
of simulations.

442
00:19:10,120 --> 00:19:13,720

443
00:19:13,720 --> 00:19:15,670
In other words, rather than
spending the effort trying to

444
00:19:15,670 --> 00:19:18,700
build a very detailed predictive
model, analytic

445
00:19:18,700 --> 00:19:21,480
model, just run a simulation
that gives us an insight to

446
00:19:21,480 --> 00:19:22,270
what the problem's doing.

447
00:19:22,270 --> 00:19:24,080
We'll refine the simulation,
and we can keep

448
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:25,445
going on like that.

449
00:19:25,445 --> 00:19:27,810
The third reason you might like
to do it is it's often

450
00:19:27,810 --> 00:19:36,210
easier to extract useful
intermediate results from a

451
00:19:36,210 --> 00:19:38,030
simulation than it is
to try and build a

452
00:19:38,030 --> 00:19:39,310
detailed analytic model.

453
00:19:39,310 --> 00:19:42,750

454
00:19:42,750 --> 00:19:45,320
And of course, the last
one is pretty obvious.

455
00:19:45,320 --> 00:19:48,680

456
00:19:48,680 --> 00:19:52,020
The advent of computers
made this possible.

457
00:19:52,020 --> 00:19:54,720
I want to just give you
an example of this.

458
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:58,150
Put yourself back in the 1700s
and think about how you would

459
00:19:58,150 --> 00:20:00,560
do a computation.

460
00:20:00,560 --> 00:20:01,490
You have two choices.

461
00:20:01,490 --> 00:20:04,140
You can crank it out by hand.

462
00:20:04,140 --> 00:20:05,550
Good luck.

463
00:20:05,550 --> 00:20:07,200
Imagine how detailed
a model you could

464
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:08,700
actually do that way.

465
00:20:08,700 --> 00:20:11,240
Or you could build
really precise,

466
00:20:11,240 --> 00:20:13,700
detailed mechanical models.

467
00:20:13,700 --> 00:20:15,450
And in fact, there are wonderful
collections of these

468
00:20:15,450 --> 00:20:17,030
from people like Leonardo.

469
00:20:17,030 --> 00:20:18,980
For example, people that wanted
to understand the solar

470
00:20:18,980 --> 00:20:23,350
system built what were called
mechanical orreries, which

471
00:20:23,350 --> 00:20:26,360
were these very complex pieces
of clockwork that allowed you

472
00:20:26,360 --> 00:20:29,530
to try and predict the motions
of the planets.

473
00:20:29,530 --> 00:20:32,680
That's a really expensive way
to try and do a simulation.

474
00:20:32,680 --> 00:20:35,620
So computation suddenly makes
things change a lot.

475
00:20:35,620 --> 00:20:39,650
Now just to give you a sense of
this, I did the following

476
00:20:39,650 --> 00:20:43,030
experiment this morning,
to see how

477
00:20:43,030 --> 00:20:44,080
important simulation is.

478
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:45,940
And I haven't really said
what simulation means.

479
00:20:45,940 --> 00:20:50,750
So simulation means giving me
an estimate, rather than a

480
00:20:50,750 --> 00:20:51,160
prediction.

481
00:20:51,160 --> 00:20:53,700
Giving me a sense of what might
happen to a system under

482
00:20:53,700 --> 00:20:55,720
certain conditions and doing
that multiple times, actually

483
00:20:55,720 --> 00:20:58,830
running, if you like, a model
of the system rather than

484
00:20:58,830 --> 00:21:01,130
trying to predict exactly
what's going to happen.

485
00:21:01,130 --> 00:21:02,590
So I did the following
experiment this morning.

486
00:21:02,590 --> 00:21:03,586
I went to Google--

487
00:21:03,586 --> 00:21:05,560
I could have gone to Bing--

488
00:21:05,560 --> 00:21:10,480
and I typed in "finance
simulation." I got 5 million

489
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:13,690
hits, most of them probably
wrong by the

490
00:21:13,690 --> 00:21:15,790
way, but that's OK.

491
00:21:15,790 --> 00:21:19,150
I typed in "biology
simulation." I

492
00:21:19,150 --> 00:21:21,900
got 11 million hits.

493
00:21:21,900 --> 00:21:25,110
I typed in "physics
simulation." I

494
00:21:25,110 --> 00:21:27,750
got 15 million hits.

495
00:21:27,750 --> 00:21:31,880
And then finally, I typed in
"game simulation." How many

496
00:21:31,880 --> 00:21:34,030
hits do you figure I got?

497
00:21:34,030 --> 00:21:37,420
North or south of 15 million?

498
00:21:37,420 --> 00:21:37,990
North.

499
00:21:37,990 --> 00:21:38,340
Yeah.

500
00:21:38,340 --> 00:21:41,090
50 million hits.

501
00:21:41,090 --> 00:21:42,550
OK, so why should you care?

502
00:21:42,550 --> 00:21:43,840
A, it's fun to do.

503
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:48,550
B, it's really a common tool
that we want to use here.

504
00:21:48,550 --> 00:21:50,880
So let's think about what a
simulation would look like,

505
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:52,160
and then we're going to
start building one.

506
00:21:52,160 --> 00:21:55,170
So the idea of a simulation,
then, is-- what we're trying

507
00:21:55,170 --> 00:22:02,730
to do is we want to
build a model with

508
00:22:02,730 --> 00:22:03,980
the following property.

509
00:22:03,980 --> 00:22:07,160

510
00:22:07,160 --> 00:22:20,156
It's going to give useful
information about the behavior

511
00:22:20,156 --> 00:22:21,640
of a system.

512
00:22:21,640 --> 00:22:25,150

513
00:22:25,150 --> 00:22:27,980
Boy, there's a statement that
has no content to it, right?

514
00:22:27,980 --> 00:22:30,940
Let me tell you what
I mean by that.

515
00:22:30,940 --> 00:22:32,690
I'm going to compare this
to an analytic model.

516
00:22:32,690 --> 00:22:35,220
An analytic model would exactly
predict what this

517
00:22:35,220 --> 00:22:37,160
system's going to do.

518
00:22:37,160 --> 00:22:39,850
With a simulation, we want to
build a model that says, if I

519
00:22:39,850 --> 00:22:42,270
give you some sense of the state
of the system, it will

520
00:22:42,270 --> 00:22:44,760
give me some information
about how that

521
00:22:44,760 --> 00:22:46,400
system is going to behave.

522
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:51,100
It may not be exactly right, But
it's going to give me some

523
00:22:51,100 --> 00:22:51,860
simulation of it.

524
00:22:51,860 --> 00:22:54,540
Another way of thinking about it
is it's going to give me an

525
00:22:54,540 --> 00:23:05,105
approximation to reality.

526
00:23:05,105 --> 00:23:09,230

527
00:23:09,230 --> 00:23:22,220
And another way of saying it
is simulation models are

528
00:23:22,220 --> 00:23:24,095
descriptive, not prescriptive.

529
00:23:24,095 --> 00:23:36,200

530
00:23:36,200 --> 00:23:38,070
So what does that mean?

531
00:23:38,070 --> 00:23:41,132
An analytic model
is prescriptive.

532
00:23:41,132 --> 00:23:42,680
You're doing 8.01 problems.

533
00:23:42,680 --> 00:23:45,420
You type in the definition of
the parameters of the problem,

534
00:23:45,420 --> 00:23:47,810
and it would tell you, at least
to the accuracy of the

535
00:23:47,810 --> 00:23:50,090
computer, exactly what's
going to happen.

536
00:23:50,090 --> 00:23:53,580
With the simulation, it says,
given a particular scenario, I

537
00:23:53,580 --> 00:23:55,890
can give you a good guess of
what's going to happen.

538
00:23:55,890 --> 00:23:57,910
But it might actually be the
case, by the way, that for

539
00:23:57,910 --> 00:24:00,590
exactly the same scenario, I
run the simulation multiple

540
00:24:00,590 --> 00:24:03,050
times and I might get slightly
different answers.

541
00:24:03,050 --> 00:24:06,270
Because maybe the world, as we
said over here, is something

542
00:24:06,270 --> 00:24:09,160
that we can't model exactly
mathematically.

543
00:24:09,160 --> 00:24:11,100
So we want to be able to have
that ability, to sort of go

544
00:24:11,100 --> 00:24:14,090
back and forth.

545
00:24:14,090 --> 00:24:18,010
Now probably the easiest way to
think about this is let's

546
00:24:18,010 --> 00:24:19,860
look at a model and
a simulation.

547
00:24:19,860 --> 00:24:22,330
So the idea here is I want
to build simulations.

548
00:24:22,330 --> 00:24:25,350
I want to control the
fact then I may not

549
00:24:25,350 --> 00:24:26,560
get a precise answer.

550
00:24:26,560 --> 00:24:28,300
I might not get the same
answer every time.

551
00:24:28,300 --> 00:24:31,750
But if I do enough simulations
of a circumstance, I can get

552
00:24:31,750 --> 00:24:35,730
some good sense which I can
refine of how this object's

553
00:24:35,730 --> 00:24:37,680
actually going to behave.

554
00:24:37,680 --> 00:24:41,360
So here's the example I'm
going to start with.

555
00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:43,680
I'm going to go back, again,
a couple hundred years.

556
00:24:43,680 --> 00:24:49,750
In 1827, a Scottish botanist
named Robert Brown observed

557
00:24:49,750 --> 00:24:52,870
that a pollen particle suspended
in water seemed to

558
00:24:52,870 --> 00:24:55,470
just float at random.

559
00:24:55,470 --> 00:24:56,420
You've probably heard
this term.

560
00:24:56,420 --> 00:24:59,490
It's called Brownian motion,
named after Robert Brown.

561
00:24:59,490 --> 00:25:01,210
He had no plausible
explanation for

562
00:25:01,210 --> 00:25:01,840
this, by the way.

563
00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:03,040
He just observed it.

564
00:25:03,040 --> 00:25:05,820
And he made no attempt to model
it mathematically, which

565
00:25:05,820 --> 00:25:07,620
kind of makes sense.

566
00:25:07,620 --> 00:25:09,781
That's 1827.

567
00:25:09,781 --> 00:25:12,880
The first really clear
mathematical model of Brownian

568
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:15,900
motion didn't come around
until 1900.

569
00:25:15,900 --> 00:25:19,020
A guy named Louis Bachelier had
a doctoral thesis called

570
00:25:19,020 --> 00:25:22,130
"The Theory of Speculation."
Part of the problem for

571
00:25:22,130 --> 00:25:26,470
Bachelier, though, was that he
didn't model Brownian in

572
00:25:26,470 --> 00:25:27,210
pollen particles.

573
00:25:27,210 --> 00:25:29,370
He did it in finance markets.

574
00:25:29,370 --> 00:25:31,580
And that was considered, at
least at the time, completely

575
00:25:31,580 --> 00:25:32,540
disreputable.

576
00:25:32,540 --> 00:25:35,280
And so nobody paid any attention
to his thesis.

577
00:25:35,280 --> 00:25:36,330
That's not going to happen
to your thesis.

578
00:25:36,330 --> 00:25:38,190
Your thesis is going to be
reputable when you get done

579
00:25:38,190 --> 00:25:39,820
with this place.

580
00:25:39,820 --> 00:25:42,220
So it took eighty years
to get to that point.

581
00:25:42,220 --> 00:25:47,310
Unfortunately for poor
Bachelier, five years later,

582
00:25:47,310 --> 00:25:51,310
another person came along and
actually built the kind of

583
00:25:51,310 --> 00:25:54,970
model that introduced this
sort of-- what's called

584
00:25:54,970 --> 00:25:56,790
stochastic thinking into
the world of physics.

585
00:25:56,790 --> 00:25:59,580
This was a model that was almost
exactly the same as

586
00:25:59,580 --> 00:26:02,570
Bachelier's, but it was
used to confirm the

587
00:26:02,570 --> 00:26:04,620
existence of atoms.

588
00:26:04,620 --> 00:26:09,910
Anybody know who did
that model in 1905?

589
00:26:09,910 --> 00:26:12,820
No physics buffs here.

590
00:26:12,820 --> 00:26:16,470
If I told you he was born in
Switzerland, would that help?

591
00:26:16,470 --> 00:26:19,210
A minor guy named
Albert Einstein.

592
00:26:19,210 --> 00:26:21,040
So that was one of the first
things Einstein did, was he

593
00:26:21,040 --> 00:26:22,630
actually built the
first really good

594
00:26:22,630 --> 00:26:24,360
model of Brownian motion.

595
00:26:24,360 --> 00:26:26,450
And that allowed, in fact, this
kind of thinking to go

596
00:26:26,450 --> 00:26:28,840
into real-world problems.

597
00:26:28,840 --> 00:26:46,000
So Brownian motion is an example
of a tool we're going

598
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:47,250
to use a lot.

599
00:26:47,250 --> 00:26:49,832

600
00:26:49,832 --> 00:26:52,090
I'm probably hiding that
below the screen where

601
00:26:52,090 --> 00:26:53,100
you can't see it.

602
00:26:53,100 --> 00:26:56,070
It's an example of what
we call a random walk.

603
00:26:56,070 --> 00:26:59,530

604
00:26:59,530 --> 00:27:01,600
Random walks you're going to
see all over the place.

605
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:04,900
They're an incredibly useful way
of building a simulation.

606
00:27:04,900 --> 00:27:08,860
And the essential idea of a
random walk is, if I've got a

607
00:27:08,860 --> 00:27:10,820
system of interacting
objects--

608
00:27:10,820 --> 00:27:12,960
could be pollen particles--

609
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:15,640
I want to model what happens
in that system under the

610
00:27:15,640 --> 00:27:18,930
assumption that each one of
those things is going to move

611
00:27:18,930 --> 00:27:22,590
at each time step under some
random distribution.

612
00:27:22,590 --> 00:27:24,050
It's going to move in a
particular direction.

613
00:27:24,050 --> 00:27:27,190
I want to model what the
overall system does.

614
00:27:27,190 --> 00:27:29,140
OK, let me give you some
examples of where this is

615
00:27:29,140 --> 00:27:31,000
really useful.

616
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:35,540
It's really useful in modeling
physical processes.

617
00:27:35,540 --> 00:27:38,280
Well, we're going to start with
pollen particles in air.

618
00:27:38,280 --> 00:27:40,950
But you could think about any
kind of particle in water.

619
00:27:40,950 --> 00:27:42,980
You could think about
any kind of air

620
00:27:42,980 --> 00:27:45,610
particle in a larger fluid.

621
00:27:45,610 --> 00:27:48,740
Ah, weather.

622
00:27:48,740 --> 00:27:50,900
Modeling weather-- if we could
really model the motion of all

623
00:27:50,900 --> 00:27:54,820
those molecules-- is just a
really large random walk.

624
00:27:54,820 --> 00:27:56,490
Random walks are really
useful in

625
00:27:56,490 --> 00:27:58,990
understanding biological processes.

626
00:27:58,990 --> 00:28:02,950
For example, the kinetics of
displacement of RNA from

627
00:28:02,950 --> 00:28:06,140
heteroduplexes of
DNA is a great

628
00:28:06,140 --> 00:28:08,790
example of a random walk.

629
00:28:08,790 --> 00:28:11,480
And in fact, people interested
in bioinformatics or

630
00:28:11,480 --> 00:28:14,810
computational biology will see
random walks used all the time

631
00:28:14,810 --> 00:28:18,800
to try and to understand the
displacements of things.

632
00:28:18,800 --> 00:28:21,420
It's really useful in
social processes.

633
00:28:21,420 --> 00:28:25,500
Movement of the stock market is
definitely a random walk,

634
00:28:25,500 --> 00:28:28,340
except for the day when the
markets are all crashing for

635
00:28:28,340 --> 00:28:29,920
unfortunate reasons.

636
00:28:29,920 --> 00:28:32,410
So it's something we
want to use a lot.

637
00:28:32,410 --> 00:28:34,430
In the example I'm going to use
to motivate a random walk,

638
00:28:34,430 --> 00:28:35,590
we're going to build
a simulation.

639
00:28:35,590 --> 00:28:37,870
Here is what was
the traditional

640
00:28:37,870 --> 00:28:39,460
view of a random walk.

641
00:28:39,460 --> 00:28:40,740
So here's the motivation.

642
00:28:40,740 --> 00:28:43,410
Excuse me a second.

643
00:28:43,410 --> 00:28:46,580
Let's take a drunken
university student.

644
00:28:46,580 --> 00:28:48,770
Not an Institute student,
a University student.

645
00:28:48,770 --> 00:28:51,270
So this is a Harvard student,
not an MIT student, because I

646
00:28:51,270 --> 00:28:53,910
know you're all well-behaved.

647
00:28:53,910 --> 00:28:56,180
At least smile at me when
I make these bad jokes.

648
00:28:56,180 --> 00:28:57,160
Thank you.

649
00:28:57,160 --> 00:28:57,370
All right.

650
00:28:57,370 --> 00:28:59,660
You've got a drunken student.

651
00:28:59,660 --> 00:29:02,190
They're out on a big field.

652
00:29:02,190 --> 00:29:04,170
And they start off in the middle
of the field, and every

653
00:29:04,170 --> 00:29:07,830
second, this student can take
one step in one of the four

654
00:29:07,830 --> 00:29:08,900
cardinal directions.

655
00:29:08,900 --> 00:29:12,670
So north, south, east, west.

656
00:29:12,670 --> 00:29:15,450
After 1,000 seconds--
after 1,000 steps--

657
00:29:15,450 --> 00:29:17,630
how far away is that student
from where he

658
00:29:17,630 --> 00:29:18,880
or she started out?

659
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:21,410

660
00:29:21,410 --> 00:29:23,740
So I need some help here.

661
00:29:23,740 --> 00:29:24,880
Guesses.

662
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:25,820
1,000 steps.

663
00:29:25,820 --> 00:29:28,990
How far away after 1,000
steps is that student--

664
00:29:28,990 --> 00:29:30,200
we'll make it a he.

665
00:29:30,200 --> 00:29:31,450
From where he started out.

666
00:29:31,450 --> 00:29:35,148

667
00:29:35,148 --> 00:29:36,561
Yeah.

668
00:29:36,561 --> 00:29:38,916
AUDIENCE: It depends on the
probability of what direction

669
00:29:38,916 --> 00:29:39,890
you're going.

670
00:29:39,890 --> 00:29:41,670
PROFESSOR: OK, so let's
assume that the steps

671
00:29:41,670 --> 00:29:42,290
were equally likely.

672
00:29:42,290 --> 00:29:43,975
The four steps-- north, south,
east, west-- they're all

673
00:29:43,975 --> 00:29:45,665
equally probable.

674
00:29:45,665 --> 00:29:48,455
AUDIENCE: [INTERPOSING VOICES]

675
00:29:48,455 --> 00:29:49,100
PROFESSOR: OK.

676
00:29:49,100 --> 00:29:51,240
So the suggestion over here
is, where he started.

677
00:29:51,240 --> 00:29:53,200
So 0 distance away.

678
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:54,270
That's not a bad guess, right?

679
00:29:54,270 --> 00:29:56,930
You're just going in different
directions.

680
00:29:56,930 --> 00:29:58,830
It's equally likely you end
up where you started.

681
00:29:58,830 --> 00:30:01,020
So one possibility is 0.

682
00:30:01,020 --> 00:30:03,060
You end up back where
you started.

683
00:30:03,060 --> 00:30:04,454
Yeah.

684
00:30:04,454 --> 00:30:05,900
AUDIENCE: Maybe 150 or so?

685
00:30:05,900 --> 00:30:08,310
PROFESSOR: Well, I'm going
to take bets here.

686
00:30:08,310 --> 00:30:09,610
I've got 150.

687
00:30:09,610 --> 00:30:10,670
It's an interesting number.

688
00:30:10,670 --> 00:30:13,190
Not bad.

689
00:30:13,190 --> 00:30:14,030
Any other guesses.

690
00:30:14,030 --> 00:30:14,930
This side of the crowd.

691
00:30:14,930 --> 00:30:16,280
I don't want to just
do the right side.

692
00:30:16,280 --> 00:30:16,960
I'm very liberal.

693
00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:18,560
I want the left side of
the crowd over here.

694
00:30:18,560 --> 00:30:19,925
Somebody over on this side.

695
00:30:19,925 --> 00:30:21,350
Help me out.

696
00:30:21,350 --> 00:30:22,170
Any other guesses?

697
00:30:22,170 --> 00:30:25,491
I've got 0, and I've
got 150 steps.

698
00:30:25,491 --> 00:30:27,630
Boy, I get no eye contact
when I do this.

699
00:30:27,630 --> 00:30:28,760
This is great.

700
00:30:28,760 --> 00:30:30,010
Yes, please.

701
00:30:30,010 --> 00:30:32,473

702
00:30:32,473 --> 00:30:34,126
AUDIENCE: 500 root 2 steps?

703
00:30:34,126 --> 00:30:35,172
PROFESSOR: 500 root 2.

704
00:30:35,172 --> 00:30:37,110
Can I drop the root
2 for second?

705
00:30:37,110 --> 00:30:39,400
The 500 is not a bad
guess, right?

706
00:30:39,400 --> 00:30:43,750
Because you're about half
the distance away.

707
00:30:43,750 --> 00:30:45,590
The root 2 we'll come
back to in a second.

708
00:30:45,590 --> 00:30:46,300
Keep that in mind.

709
00:30:46,300 --> 00:30:46,360
All right.

710
00:30:46,360 --> 00:30:46,830
500.

711
00:30:46,830 --> 00:30:52,380
So we've got 0, we've got
150, we've got 500.

712
00:30:52,380 --> 00:30:54,120
Well, gee, that's the whole
point of building the

713
00:30:54,120 --> 00:30:54,750
simulation.

714
00:30:54,750 --> 00:30:56,820
Let's see if we can figure out
what might happen here.

715
00:30:56,820 --> 00:30:57,750
Ok.

716
00:30:57,750 --> 00:30:59,960
And I'm going to build the
simulation in a second.

717
00:30:59,960 --> 00:31:04,970
But before I do that, one of
the good things to do is to

718
00:31:04,970 --> 00:31:09,400
try and build a simple model
that we could use to get an

719
00:31:09,400 --> 00:31:12,000
intuition about what's
going to happen.

720
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:14,770
So I'm going to start with
a very simple model here.

721
00:31:14,770 --> 00:31:22,280

722
00:31:22,280 --> 00:31:23,530
There's my field.

723
00:31:23,530 --> 00:31:25,900

724
00:31:25,900 --> 00:31:28,570
The guys who mow the lawn at
Fenway have been over and very

725
00:31:28,570 --> 00:31:32,680
nicely put x- and y-axes
onto this field.

726
00:31:32,680 --> 00:31:37,870
And let's assume the students
starts off there.

727
00:31:37,870 --> 00:31:38,990
We'll just call that
the origin.

728
00:31:38,990 --> 00:31:40,720
It doesn't matter what it is,
but that's where the students

729
00:31:40,720 --> 00:31:42,220
starts off.

730
00:31:42,220 --> 00:31:46,550
And what I want to do is I want
to get a very rough sense

731
00:31:46,550 --> 00:31:49,220
of how far away the student
might go after a few steps.

732
00:31:49,220 --> 00:31:51,360
We won't be able to go very far,
but enough steps that we

733
00:31:51,360 --> 00:31:52,430
can start estimating this.

734
00:31:52,430 --> 00:31:54,730
So they start there.

735
00:31:54,730 --> 00:32:00,400
After one step, there
are the places the

736
00:32:00,400 --> 00:32:02,070
student could end up.

737
00:32:02,070 --> 00:32:03,490
Equally likely.

738
00:32:03,490 --> 00:32:11,900
So after one step, if I want to
build a distance associated

739
00:32:11,900 --> 00:32:16,630
probability, there's probability
1 they're 1 unit

740
00:32:16,630 --> 00:32:20,170
away, no matter which
direction they went.

741
00:32:20,170 --> 00:32:22,090
OK, let's take this one here.

742
00:32:22,090 --> 00:32:25,240

743
00:32:25,240 --> 00:32:27,510
Let's assume the student
went east.

744
00:32:27,510 --> 00:32:29,210
In fact, they're all going
to be roughly the same.

745
00:32:29,210 --> 00:32:32,170
And the second step, where
can the student go?

746
00:32:32,170 --> 00:32:37,780
He can go there, he can go
there, he can go there, or he

747
00:32:37,780 --> 00:32:38,560
could go there.

748
00:32:38,560 --> 00:32:40,410
Right?

749
00:32:40,410 --> 00:32:41,860
So what are the distances
here?

750
00:32:41,860 --> 00:32:51,400
Well, in one out of four cases,
he's at a distance 0,

751
00:32:51,400 --> 00:32:53,590
which would be back to where
we started, which is that

752
00:32:53,590 --> 00:32:56,230
original pretty good guess.

753
00:32:56,230 --> 00:32:59,220
If he goes there or he goes
there, those are both what

754
00:32:59,220 --> 00:33:00,090
distance away?

755
00:33:00,090 --> 00:33:01,890
Root 2, right?

756
00:33:01,890 --> 00:33:07,550
So it could be root 2 away,
2 out of 4 times.

757
00:33:07,550 --> 00:33:10,300
And if we went east again,
we're 2 units away.

758
00:33:10,300 --> 00:33:15,120

759
00:33:15,120 --> 00:33:18,300
Again, with probability
1 in 4.

760
00:33:18,300 --> 00:33:20,680
I'm cheating slightly here, in
the sense that I should do the

761
00:33:20,680 --> 00:33:23,530
same things if the first step
was north, south, or west, but

762
00:33:23,530 --> 00:33:24,610
they're all symmetric to this.

763
00:33:24,610 --> 00:33:25,630
So it'll all come out
the same way.

764
00:33:25,630 --> 00:33:27,645
So there is what happens
after two steps.

765
00:33:27,645 --> 00:33:30,150

766
00:33:30,150 --> 00:33:31,490
Now let's do one more step.

767
00:33:31,490 --> 00:33:32,560
It's going to get a
little messy here.

768
00:33:32,560 --> 00:33:34,920
But suppose I want to
go three steps.

769
00:33:34,920 --> 00:33:40,630

770
00:33:40,630 --> 00:33:41,440
About three possibilities.

771
00:33:41,440 --> 00:33:42,130
Well, I've got three
possibilities.

772
00:33:42,130 --> 00:33:46,690
If I'm in this case, which is
the 0 case, I'm here, in which

773
00:33:46,690 --> 00:33:50,750
case no matter which step
I take, I'm 1 unit away.

774
00:33:50,750 --> 00:33:53,780
So this will say, distance 1.

775
00:33:53,780 --> 00:33:56,810
And the probability of being
here was 1/4, so the

776
00:33:56,810 --> 00:33:59,760
probability again is still
1/4 that one unit away.

777
00:33:59,760 --> 00:34:02,670

778
00:34:02,670 --> 00:34:04,410
Let's take one of these,
the root 2 ones.

779
00:34:04,410 --> 00:34:06,210
That says I'm either
here or I'm there.

780
00:34:06,210 --> 00:34:06,980
They're going to be symmetric.

781
00:34:06,980 --> 00:34:10,080
If I'm here, where can I go?

782
00:34:10,080 --> 00:34:14,139
I've got possibilities
going to those.

783
00:34:14,139 --> 00:34:18,310
So these two are 1 unit away.

784
00:34:18,310 --> 00:34:20,850
So half the time I'm 1
unit away, and it was

785
00:34:20,850 --> 00:34:22,510
1/2 that got me there.

786
00:34:22,510 --> 00:34:25,690

787
00:34:25,690 --> 00:34:27,260
Did I do that right?

788
00:34:27,260 --> 00:34:29,510
Yes.

789
00:34:29,510 --> 00:34:31,980
That's also with 1/4.

790
00:34:31,980 --> 00:34:34,690
That was getting if I went
here or I went there.

791
00:34:34,690 --> 00:34:41,749
If I'm up here or I'm over
there, that's root 5 away.

792
00:34:41,749 --> 00:34:45,139
So let me put that over here.

793
00:34:45,139 --> 00:34:47,290
So I've got a probability of
1/2 getting there, and a

794
00:34:47,290 --> 00:34:50,139
probability of 1/2 from here
of getting that, so that's

795
00:34:50,139 --> 00:34:53,139
also with probability of 1/4.

796
00:34:53,139 --> 00:34:54,960
And then what's the one
case I have left?

797
00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:58,800
The case I have left is I went
all the way over to here, two

798
00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:01,420
steps over, in which case
I'm going to go what?

799
00:35:01,420 --> 00:35:03,310
There, there, there, or there.

800
00:35:03,310 --> 00:35:04,330
If I just pull these
together--

801
00:35:04,330 --> 00:35:06,140
I'm just going to
do them for you.

802
00:35:06,140 --> 00:35:10,240
That says, I have a probability
of being 1 away

803
00:35:10,240 --> 00:35:16,490
with probability 1/16, root 5
away with probability 1/8 --

804
00:35:16,490 --> 00:35:19,710
and I'm running out of room here
-- and 3 units away with

805
00:35:19,710 --> 00:35:21,515
probability of 1/16.

806
00:35:21,515 --> 00:35:24,500

807
00:35:24,500 --> 00:35:25,965
Don't sweat the details.

808
00:35:25,965 --> 00:35:27,910
What you can see is I'm
just building this up.

809
00:35:27,910 --> 00:35:31,450
What I want you to see is what
do the distances look like?

810
00:35:31,450 --> 00:35:37,640
After one step, I'm
one unit away.

811
00:35:37,640 --> 00:35:41,710
After two steps,
that was this.

812
00:35:41,710 --> 00:35:42,940
You can kind of do the
math in your head.

813
00:35:42,940 --> 00:35:44,880
What's the expected
distance away?

814
00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:47,600
What's the average distance
I'd be away?

815
00:35:47,600 --> 00:35:52,060
Well, it's 0 times 1/4,
plus root 2 times 1/2,

816
00:35:52,060 --> 00:35:54,290
plus 2 times 1/4.

817
00:35:54,290 --> 00:35:58,040
So that's 1.4, that's 2.8, and
that's 4.8 divided by 4.

818
00:35:58,040 --> 00:36:07,550
So it's about 1.2.

819
00:36:07,550 --> 00:36:09,300
Now I'm sure you can do the math
for three steps in your

820
00:36:09,300 --> 00:36:10,990
head, right?

821
00:36:10,990 --> 00:36:12,330
Yeah, right.

822
00:36:12,330 --> 00:36:14,330
But if I do that, if I add those
things up-- you can go

823
00:36:14,330 --> 00:36:16,680
do this yourself-- what you'll
find is that this is

824
00:36:16,680 --> 00:36:23,870
about 1.4 or 1.5.

825
00:36:23,870 --> 00:36:25,010
Let me make it 1.4.

826
00:36:25,010 --> 00:36:26,300
It's probably a little
bit closer.

827
00:36:26,300 --> 00:36:31,080

828
00:36:31,080 --> 00:36:31,560
All right.

829
00:36:31,560 --> 00:36:34,280
Why was I doing that?

830
00:36:34,280 --> 00:36:36,150
This is something you want to
do as you start building a

831
00:36:36,150 --> 00:36:39,530
simulation, which is do a little
bit of a calculation to

832
00:36:39,530 --> 00:36:43,360
get a sense of what you
expect to happen here.

833
00:36:43,360 --> 00:36:47,500
So what conclusion could
I draw from that?

834
00:36:47,500 --> 00:36:50,580
Admittedly on very small
numbers, it looks like the

835
00:36:50,580 --> 00:36:55,060
more steps the Harvard student
takes, on average the further

836
00:36:55,060 --> 00:36:58,450
away they are from the
starting point.

837
00:36:58,450 --> 00:37:00,670
So your 0 was a great guess,
but it's probably not

838
00:37:00,670 --> 00:37:01,720
going to work here.

839
00:37:01,720 --> 00:37:03,890
And we want to see why.

840
00:37:03,890 --> 00:37:08,150
On the other hand, 500
that looks-- well,

841
00:37:08,150 --> 00:37:09,430
maybe we're still OK.

842
00:37:09,430 --> 00:37:11,460
Three steps, half of 3
would be 1 and 1/2.

843
00:37:11,460 --> 00:37:13,960
So maybe the 500's OK.

844
00:37:13,960 --> 00:37:16,120
Let's see what happens
if we do this.

845
00:37:16,120 --> 00:37:21,320
So what I want to do is see
how I could build a set of

846
00:37:21,320 --> 00:37:25,180
classes that would let me
build this simulation.

847
00:37:25,180 --> 00:37:27,760
And part of the design process
here is I want to try and

848
00:37:27,760 --> 00:37:30,930
invent classes that correspond
to the types of things I

849
00:37:30,930 --> 00:37:32,890
expect to see happening.

850
00:37:32,890 --> 00:37:35,430
So in this case,
what do I have?

851
00:37:35,430 --> 00:37:40,080
I need to model a drunk, I need
to model a field, which

852
00:37:40,080 --> 00:37:42,120
is where the drunk's wandering
around in.

853
00:37:42,120 --> 00:37:44,290
And I'll need a third thing,
which may not be obvious

854
00:37:44,290 --> 00:37:44,890
immediately.

855
00:37:44,890 --> 00:37:46,840
But the third thing I'm going
to need-- so let me just put

856
00:37:46,840 --> 00:37:47,540
the pieces up.

857
00:37:47,540 --> 00:37:54,330
I need a drunk, I need a field,
and I need to keep

858
00:37:54,330 --> 00:37:57,080
track of where the drunk
is in the field.

859
00:37:57,080 --> 00:37:59,080
So I'm going to pull out another
class I'm going to

860
00:37:59,080 --> 00:38:02,210
call a location, that's going
to tell me where the drunk

861
00:38:02,210 --> 00:38:04,870
actually is.

862
00:38:04,870 --> 00:38:05,830
OK.

863
00:38:05,830 --> 00:38:08,880
With that in mind, I'm going
to show you some code.

864
00:38:08,880 --> 00:38:11,340
I'm going to walk through it
reasonably carefully, just to

865
00:38:11,340 --> 00:38:12,940
let you see what
it looks like.

866
00:38:12,940 --> 00:38:18,660
So there is my class definition
for a location.

867
00:38:18,660 --> 00:38:20,610
Now at this stage in the course,
hopefully you can look

868
00:38:20,610 --> 00:38:22,530
at that and already see
the main pieces of it.

869
00:38:22,530 --> 00:38:23,510
So what do we have in here?

870
00:38:23,510 --> 00:38:25,820
Well, we going to have
an initialization.

871
00:38:25,820 --> 00:38:26,930
You can kind of see
that right there.

872
00:38:26,930 --> 00:38:29,670
When I create a Location, I'm
giving it an x and y.

873
00:38:29,670 --> 00:38:30,850
I'm going to make
an assumption,

874
00:38:30,850 --> 00:38:32,030
which is they're floats.

875
00:38:32,030 --> 00:38:33,700
I'll come back to that
in a second.

876
00:38:33,700 --> 00:38:35,040
And that's just going to
store them away in

877
00:38:35,040 --> 00:38:36,040
some internal variables.

878
00:38:36,040 --> 00:38:37,090
That's things you've
done before.

879
00:38:37,090 --> 00:38:40,590
So self.x gets that value,
self.y gets that value.

880
00:38:40,590 --> 00:38:46,530
And of course, I could get out
the values right there.

881
00:38:46,530 --> 00:38:48,840
I need to know where
the drunk goes.

882
00:38:48,840 --> 00:38:52,540
So one of the things I'd like
to do is to say, given the

883
00:38:52,540 --> 00:38:54,680
current location of the drunk,
I might like to know how far

884
00:38:54,680 --> 00:38:57,280
away is that from some other
location, like the place the

885
00:38:57,280 --> 00:38:58,700
drunk started.

886
00:38:58,700 --> 00:39:01,270
So that last method down
here, distance from--

887
00:39:01,270 --> 00:39:03,920
notice what it's going to do.

888
00:39:03,920 --> 00:39:06,720
It says, if you give
me another,

889
00:39:06,720 --> 00:39:08,860
which is another location--

890
00:39:08,860 --> 00:39:10,960
remember, self will point
to my instance--

891
00:39:10,960 --> 00:39:11,440
what can I do?

892
00:39:11,440 --> 00:39:13,930
Well, I can just do Pythagoras's
theorem to figure

893
00:39:13,930 --> 00:39:18,470
out how far away am I. I get
the x- and y-coordinates of

894
00:39:18,470 --> 00:39:19,370
the other location.

895
00:39:19,370 --> 00:39:21,410
I get my own x- and
y-coordinates.

896
00:39:21,410 --> 00:39:24,290
And then I just take those
distances squared and take the

897
00:39:24,290 --> 00:39:24,880
square root of them.

898
00:39:24,880 --> 00:39:26,330
So it's just giving
me distance away,

899
00:39:26,330 --> 00:39:28,680
which is pretty nice.

900
00:39:28,680 --> 00:39:30,620
There's one other method here
which is a little funky.

901
00:39:30,620 --> 00:39:31,830
This is a design choice.

902
00:39:31,830 --> 00:39:36,530
And that method is the one
up here called move.

903
00:39:36,530 --> 00:39:38,960
So the background to this
is going to have

904
00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:41,210
a drunk at a location.

905
00:39:41,210 --> 00:39:43,620
one of the things I
will want is to be

906
00:39:43,620 --> 00:39:44,900
able to change location.

907
00:39:44,900 --> 00:39:47,600
So move says, if you give
me a change in x

908
00:39:47,600 --> 00:39:48,770
and a change in y--

909
00:39:48,770 --> 00:39:50,510
I'm going to assume
they're floats--

910
00:39:50,510 --> 00:39:53,960
I will give you back the new
location, which is to go from

911
00:39:53,960 --> 00:39:56,240
my x and y by some amount.

912
00:39:56,240 --> 00:39:57,700
It could be in the
east direction.

913
00:39:57,700 --> 00:39:58,990
It could be in the
north direction.

914
00:39:58,990 --> 00:40:00,150
But notice what it returns.

915
00:40:00,150 --> 00:40:04,190
It returns a new instance
of a Location.

916
00:40:04,190 --> 00:40:05,440
OK.

917
00:40:05,440 --> 00:40:07,600

918
00:40:07,600 --> 00:40:10,170
I made a couple of assumptions
which are worth

919
00:40:10,170 --> 00:40:12,200
thinking about here.

920
00:40:12,200 --> 00:40:13,960
So one assumption is
I'm assuming that

921
00:40:13,960 --> 00:40:16,330
this is a 2D world.

922
00:40:16,330 --> 00:40:17,580
You can't elevate.

923
00:40:17,580 --> 00:40:18,780
You can't rise up.

924
00:40:18,780 --> 00:40:20,330
There's no change in altitude.

925
00:40:20,330 --> 00:40:22,810
That kind of makes sense.

926
00:40:22,810 --> 00:40:25,640
The second assumption I made was
I said, I want to build it

927
00:40:25,640 --> 00:40:30,220
in so that things like delta-x
and delta-y are floats.

928
00:40:30,220 --> 00:40:31,370
What is that doing?

929
00:40:31,370 --> 00:40:33,950
Well, that's saying, I don't
want to restrict myself to

930
00:40:33,950 --> 00:40:37,440
just moves that are only in
the cardinal directions.

931
00:40:37,440 --> 00:40:39,790
I'm going to start there, but
initially, I'd like to have

932
00:40:39,790 --> 00:40:42,720
the ability that the move could
be along a diagonal, or

933
00:40:42,720 --> 00:40:44,090
it could be some partial step.

934
00:40:44,090 --> 00:40:47,980
So notice I'm making a choice
there that is kind of nice.

935
00:40:47,980 --> 00:40:48,210
All right.

936
00:40:48,210 --> 00:40:51,380
That gives me locations.

937
00:40:51,380 --> 00:40:54,880
And that's a pretty
straightforward class.

938
00:40:54,880 --> 00:40:56,000
So I've got locations.

939
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:57,600
That's always a good start.

940
00:40:57,600 --> 00:41:00,730
I have this.

941
00:41:00,730 --> 00:41:02,140
Now again, I want
to model a drunk

942
00:41:02,140 --> 00:41:03,330
wandering around in a field.

943
00:41:03,330 --> 00:41:06,090
So the second thing I need is I
need to say, what's a field

944
00:41:06,090 --> 00:41:07,680
going to be?

945
00:41:07,680 --> 00:41:11,390
And I want to show you
that definition,

946
00:41:11,390 --> 00:41:12,640
which is right here.

947
00:41:12,640 --> 00:41:16,430

948
00:41:16,430 --> 00:41:26,840
And a field is basically going
to be something that maps

949
00:41:26,840 --> 00:41:30,315
drunks to locations.

950
00:41:30,315 --> 00:41:34,190

951
00:41:34,190 --> 00:41:36,970
So a field is just going to
be a collection of drunks,

952
00:41:36,970 --> 00:41:38,500
keeping track of
where they are.

953
00:41:38,500 --> 00:41:40,870
So let's look at what that
definition says.

954
00:41:40,870 --> 00:41:46,620
When I create a field, right up
here at the top it sets up

955
00:41:46,620 --> 00:41:50,490
a variable inside of that
instance, just called drunks.

956
00:41:50,490 --> 00:41:52,631
And we're going to
use a dictionary.

957
00:41:52,631 --> 00:41:54,560
We could use other choices, but
the dictionary is going to

958
00:41:54,560 --> 00:41:55,820
be nice, because it's
going to let us keep

959
00:41:55,820 --> 00:41:57,270
track of the drunks.

960
00:41:57,270 --> 00:41:59,330
I can add a drunk
to the field.

961
00:41:59,330 --> 00:42:02,250

962
00:42:02,250 --> 00:42:03,360
So notice what it says.

963
00:42:03,360 --> 00:42:06,360
It says, given I've got a field,
I'm assuming I have a

964
00:42:06,360 --> 00:42:09,570
drunk and a location, because
the drunk's got to be in a

965
00:42:09,570 --> 00:42:10,630
particular location.

966
00:42:10,630 --> 00:42:12,850
Notice what it does.

967
00:42:12,850 --> 00:42:15,490
First of all, it checks to make
sure that I don't already

968
00:42:15,490 --> 00:42:17,720
have this person in
my collection.

969
00:42:17,720 --> 00:42:20,620
So that first check there says,
if this particular drunk

970
00:42:20,620 --> 00:42:24,260
is already in my dictionary,
I complain.

971
00:42:24,260 --> 00:42:28,010
You can be drunk enough to see
double, but you can't be drunk

972
00:42:28,010 --> 00:42:30,380
enough to be double.

973
00:42:30,380 --> 00:42:32,630
Another bad joke right
off the back wall.

974
00:42:32,630 --> 00:42:33,940
Great.

975
00:42:33,940 --> 00:42:35,180
OK, so what else do I want?

976
00:42:35,180 --> 00:42:38,700
Otherwise, notice what
I'm going to do here.

977
00:42:38,700 --> 00:42:40,170
I want to make sure
you can see these

978
00:42:40,170 --> 00:42:41,780
things fairly cleanly.

979
00:42:41,780 --> 00:42:44,170
If I'm going to add a
drunk, what do I do?

980
00:42:44,170 --> 00:42:49,320
Into the dictionary, under that
label of drunk, I'm going

981
00:42:49,320 --> 00:42:51,820
to insert a value corresponding
with that label.

982
00:42:51,820 --> 00:42:53,950
And the values going
to be the location.

983
00:42:53,950 --> 00:42:56,890
So my representation here is now
a dictionary of drunks and

984
00:42:56,890 --> 00:42:58,520
where they are.

985
00:42:58,520 --> 00:43:01,270
And that's going to be handy
as I want to use this.

986
00:43:01,270 --> 00:43:04,120
And again, if I want to get out
the location, well, I just

987
00:43:04,120 --> 00:43:05,600
return exactly that.

988
00:43:05,600 --> 00:43:09,910
The final piece is, when I go
to move the drunk, I've got

989
00:43:09,910 --> 00:43:11,950
some tests here to make sure
that I actually have a drunk.

990
00:43:11,950 --> 00:43:15,380
But otherwise, I'm going to ask
the drunk to take a step

991
00:43:15,380 --> 00:43:18,350
right there.

992
00:43:18,350 --> 00:43:19,630
We have to say what
a drunk does.

993
00:43:19,630 --> 00:43:23,000
That's going to give me back a
change in x and a change in y.

994
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:26,870
And then notice the funky
little call below here.

995
00:43:26,870 --> 00:43:27,620
This says what?

996
00:43:27,620 --> 00:43:31,670
The right-hand side says, I get
the dictionary of drunks.

997
00:43:31,670 --> 00:43:35,170
I go in and index into it to
get out the actual drunk.

998
00:43:35,170 --> 00:43:36,820
That's this first
part right here.

999
00:43:36,820 --> 00:43:39,900

1000
00:43:39,900 --> 00:43:40,920
That gives me back what?

1001
00:43:40,920 --> 00:43:42,450
It gives me an instance.

1002
00:43:42,450 --> 00:43:46,570
So the dot says, for that
particular drunk, get its move

1003
00:43:46,570 --> 00:43:50,040
method, which was that
call, and have it

1004
00:43:50,040 --> 00:43:53,150
move by that amount.

1005
00:43:53,150 --> 00:43:56,470
And that returns for me then a
location which I can store

1006
00:43:56,470 --> 00:43:59,610
back into the list.

1007
00:43:59,610 --> 00:44:01,210
All right.

1008
00:44:01,210 --> 00:44:02,930
I made some assumptions
about Field.

1009
00:44:02,930 --> 00:44:05,900
They're worth pointing out.

1010
00:44:05,900 --> 00:44:08,270
No constraints on locations.

1011
00:44:08,270 --> 00:44:10,470
How big is this field?

1012
00:44:10,470 --> 00:44:11,590
As big as you want.

1013
00:44:11,590 --> 00:44:14,960
So I didn't build in a real
physical representation of the

1014
00:44:14,960 --> 00:44:17,410
limits of the field with every
location represented.

1015
00:44:17,410 --> 00:44:19,230
I just said, it's just a
collection of drunks.

1016
00:44:19,230 --> 00:44:21,760
So there's no limits on how
far the drunk can go.

1017
00:44:21,760 --> 00:44:24,385
The second assumption
I made here is I can

1018
00:44:24,385 --> 00:44:25,350
have multiple drunks.

1019
00:44:25,350 --> 00:44:27,320
And we're going to have a
simulation of that in a while.

1020
00:44:27,320 --> 00:44:29,630
You can imagine it's going to
be fun watching them collide

1021
00:44:29,630 --> 00:44:30,060
with each other.

1022
00:44:30,060 --> 00:44:31,210
All right.

1023
00:44:31,210 --> 00:44:33,860
And the third thing is, it
says nothing about the

1024
00:44:33,860 --> 00:44:36,450
patterns in which
the drunk moves.

1025
00:44:36,450 --> 00:44:38,370
So this is a design to
keep this clean.

1026
00:44:38,370 --> 00:44:40,390
It says nothing about
how the drunks move.

1027
00:44:40,390 --> 00:44:42,430
It simply says, give me
a change in x and y.

1028
00:44:42,430 --> 00:44:45,090
I'll change the location.

1029
00:44:45,090 --> 00:44:47,630
The last piece is we're going to
capture how the drunk moves

1030
00:44:47,630 --> 00:44:49,460
in a drunk.

1031
00:44:49,460 --> 00:44:51,200
And there's the definition
of the drunk.

1032
00:44:51,200 --> 00:44:54,740

1033
00:44:54,740 --> 00:44:57,285
What does that say to do?

1034
00:44:57,285 --> 00:45:00,090
Well, we're going to give it
a name, to start it off.

1035
00:45:00,090 --> 00:45:02,730
And the only method it has is
that thing that's going to do

1036
00:45:02,730 --> 00:45:04,390
a takeStep.

1037
00:45:04,390 --> 00:45:07,850
And here's where we're going to
build in the choices about

1038
00:45:07,850 --> 00:45:10,810
how they can move, what you
asked about earlier.

1039
00:45:10,810 --> 00:45:12,250
Notice what I've done there.

1040
00:45:12,250 --> 00:45:16,830
In this case, I've said, I'm
going to pick at random from

1041
00:45:16,830 --> 00:45:22,360
this set, stepChoices.

1042
00:45:22,360 --> 00:45:24,450
And that's where I'm building
in the idea that it's only

1043
00:45:24,450 --> 00:45:27,010
going to move plus or minus 1
in the x and y direction--

1044
00:45:27,010 --> 00:45:28,540
north, south, east, west.

1045
00:45:28,540 --> 00:45:30,500
I could clearly change that.

1046
00:45:30,500 --> 00:45:33,380
I'm also building in here that
it's equally likely, because

1047
00:45:33,380 --> 00:45:35,500
random picks one of those
equally likely.

1048
00:45:35,500 --> 00:45:37,120
I might decide to change that.

1049
00:45:37,120 --> 00:45:38,860
And I can certainly do that
if I want to move to other

1050
00:45:38,860 --> 00:45:39,340
directions.

1051
00:45:39,340 --> 00:45:42,870
But right now, that's where
I'm going to build it in.

1052
00:45:42,870 --> 00:45:43,780
OK.

1053
00:45:43,780 --> 00:45:46,340
So now we're ready to
try the simulation.

1054
00:45:46,340 --> 00:45:48,270
We've got what?

1055
00:45:48,270 --> 00:45:48,900
We've got location.

1056
00:45:48,900 --> 00:45:50,820
That's just representing
a place.

1057
00:45:50,820 --> 00:45:51,840
We've got fields.

1058
00:45:51,840 --> 00:45:54,680
That just lets us map
drunks to locations.

1059
00:45:54,680 --> 00:45:56,990
And then we've got the ability
to move the drunk around.

1060
00:45:56,990 --> 00:46:02,350
So I can now think
about making this

1061
00:46:02,350 --> 00:46:04,480
actually move around.

1062
00:46:04,480 --> 00:46:06,970
So let me show you
a quick example.

1063
00:46:06,970 --> 00:46:08,220
Let's create a drunk.

1064
00:46:08,220 --> 00:46:17,170

1065
00:46:17,170 --> 00:46:19,630
I'm picking the obvious
person.

1066
00:46:19,630 --> 00:46:23,160
I'm going to create
a location.

1067
00:46:23,160 --> 00:46:27,320
We'll call the origin just
the spot at 0, 0.

1068
00:46:27,320 --> 00:46:30,270

1069
00:46:30,270 --> 00:46:34,320
And I need to create a
field which I can do.

1070
00:46:34,320 --> 00:46:38,810
And then I'm going to
add Homer to this

1071
00:46:38,810 --> 00:46:43,420
field at the origin.

1072
00:46:43,420 --> 00:46:44,970
And now the last thing I want to
do is I want to have Homer

1073
00:46:44,970 --> 00:46:45,460
wander around.

1074
00:46:45,460 --> 00:46:46,370
I want to see how far he goes.

1075
00:46:46,370 --> 00:46:48,470
So I'm going to build a little
function over here-- you can

1076
00:46:48,470 --> 00:46:52,900
see right there-- called walk,
which takes the field, takes a

1077
00:46:52,900 --> 00:46:55,810
drunk in the field, and says how
many steps do I want him

1078
00:46:55,810 --> 00:46:56,790
to stagger around with?

1079
00:46:56,790 --> 00:46:57,560
And what's it going to do?

1080
00:46:57,560 --> 00:46:59,910
I'm going to set the start
location to be where the drunk

1081
00:46:59,910 --> 00:47:01,190
was initially.

1082
00:47:01,190 --> 00:47:04,020
It might be at the origin or
it might be somewhere else.

1083
00:47:04,020 --> 00:47:06,180
And then I'm just going to run
through that number of steps.

1084
00:47:06,180 --> 00:47:08,380
So range is just saying, take
the number of steps, just

1085
00:47:08,380 --> 00:47:09,150
moving the drunk.

1086
00:47:09,150 --> 00:47:11,480
And then I'll return
how far away he is.

1087
00:47:11,480 --> 00:47:17,580
So if I do that here, I can do
walk with that field, with my

1088
00:47:17,580 --> 00:47:18,350
drunk, Homer.

1089
00:47:18,350 --> 00:47:20,890
And let's take 10 steps.

1090
00:47:20,890 --> 00:47:22,090
Hmm.

1091
00:47:22,090 --> 00:47:23,200
That's interesting.

1092
00:47:23,200 --> 00:47:24,450
Let's try it again.

1093
00:47:24,450 --> 00:47:30,830

1094
00:47:30,830 --> 00:47:32,205
I was getting worried
there for second.

1095
00:47:32,205 --> 00:47:35,780

1096
00:47:35,780 --> 00:47:40,640
So we're getting an interesting
range of values.

1097
00:47:40,640 --> 00:47:42,760
So here's the last thing
I'd like to do.

1098
00:47:42,760 --> 00:47:45,360
Let's actually do a simulation
of this.

1099
00:47:45,360 --> 00:47:47,350
And I'm going to do this
reasonably quickly. simWalks

1100
00:47:47,350 --> 00:47:51,370
right here is simply going to
do what I just did, but

1101
00:47:51,370 --> 00:47:52,680
multiple times.

1102
00:47:52,680 --> 00:47:55,030
That is, it's going to take a
drunk, a field, some number of

1103
00:47:55,030 --> 00:47:59,370
steps, and it's going to run a
bunch of trials, however many

1104
00:47:59,370 --> 00:48:00,190
trials I want to get.

1105
00:48:00,190 --> 00:48:01,920
So I do what I just
did over here, and

1106
00:48:01,920 --> 00:48:03,610
collect those together.

1107
00:48:03,610 --> 00:48:07,370
And then I can just print out
some statistics about how far

1108
00:48:07,370 --> 00:48:09,820
away did the drunk
get as I do that.

1109
00:48:09,820 --> 00:48:11,350
And that's what drunk
test is going to do.

1110
00:48:11,350 --> 00:48:13,490
We're going to do it for 10
steps, 100 steps, 1,000

1111
00:48:13,490 --> 00:48:14,350
steps, and so on.

1112
00:48:14,350 --> 00:48:16,420
So let me simply run that.

1113
00:48:16,420 --> 00:48:19,780
I run drunkTest.

1114
00:48:19,780 --> 00:48:21,480
And we'll do it with
10 trials each.

1115
00:48:21,480 --> 00:48:26,160

1116
00:48:26,160 --> 00:48:27,470
OK.

1117
00:48:27,470 --> 00:48:29,700
Does that look right?

1118
00:48:29,700 --> 00:48:32,550
Does that look good?

1119
00:48:32,550 --> 00:48:35,170
You can tell this is
a trick question.

1120
00:48:35,170 --> 00:48:36,590
So what should you be
looking for there?

1121
00:48:36,590 --> 00:48:36,970
Look at it.

1122
00:48:36,970 --> 00:48:39,780
It says, if I take 10 steps, on
average I'm about 2 and 1/2

1123
00:48:39,780 --> 00:48:40,760
steps away.

1124
00:48:40,760 --> 00:48:43,270
If I take 100 steps, on average
I'm less than two

1125
00:48:43,270 --> 00:48:44,300
steps away.

1126
00:48:44,300 --> 00:48:46,790
1,000 steps, I'm about
two steps away.

1127
00:48:46,790 --> 00:48:49,150
10,000 steps, I'm about
two steps away.

1128
00:48:49,150 --> 00:48:52,540
100,000 steps, on average I'm
about two steps away.

1129
00:48:52,540 --> 00:48:53,970
Wait a minute.

1130
00:48:53,970 --> 00:48:58,170
Didn't we say that it looked
like, over on that board

1131
00:48:58,170 --> 00:49:00,280
there, that as I increased the
number of steps, I got a

1132
00:49:00,280 --> 00:49:02,885
little bit further away?

1133
00:49:02,885 --> 00:49:04,870
Hmm.

1134
00:49:04,870 --> 00:49:06,030
So I've done this
deliberately.

1135
00:49:06,030 --> 00:49:07,210
This suggests what?

1136
00:49:07,210 --> 00:49:10,830
The first key point, think about
what your simulation

1137
00:49:10,830 --> 00:49:11,550
should return.

1138
00:49:11,550 --> 00:49:13,650
What are good examples
to think about?

1139
00:49:13,650 --> 00:49:15,940
Because this doesn't
look right.

1140
00:49:15,940 --> 00:49:16,950
OK.

1141
00:49:16,950 --> 00:49:19,850
So here's how I could test it.

1142
00:49:19,850 --> 00:49:23,110
Why don't I try a simulation
on values for

1143
00:49:23,110 --> 00:49:25,580
which I know the answer?

1144
00:49:25,580 --> 00:49:29,050
So I'm going to go back in
here, and right here, I'm

1145
00:49:29,050 --> 00:49:30,555
going to replace this with--

1146
00:49:30,555 --> 00:49:33,270

1147
00:49:33,270 --> 00:49:40,240
we're either going to take
zero steps or one step.

1148
00:49:40,240 --> 00:49:41,490
Let's run that.

1149
00:49:41,490 --> 00:49:44,000

1150
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:45,750
Oh, don't do that to me.

1151
00:49:45,750 --> 00:49:47,200
Oh, yes, I do have an error.

1152
00:49:47,200 --> 00:49:48,736
Thank you.

1153
00:49:48,736 --> 00:49:51,580
Get rid of it right there.

1154
00:49:51,580 --> 00:49:54,730
Almost out of time, so
this is perfect.

1155
00:49:54,730 --> 00:49:56,590
And now let's try
drunkStep again.

1156
00:49:56,590 --> 00:50:00,150

1157
00:50:00,150 --> 00:50:01,790
Wow.

1158
00:50:01,790 --> 00:50:05,390
If I take a random walk taking
no steps, on average I end up

1159
00:50:05,390 --> 00:50:08,360
2 and 1/2 units away.

1160
00:50:08,360 --> 00:50:10,670
I teleported.

1161
00:50:10,670 --> 00:50:12,890
That's pretty amazing.

1162
00:50:12,890 --> 00:50:16,430
And with perfect timing, we'll
figure out what's wrong with

1163
00:50:16,430 --> 00:50:19,140
my simulation next time.

1164
00:50:19,140 --> 00:50:20,390
Thanks.

1165
00:50:20,390 --> 00:50:23,637
