00:00:20,870 --> 00:00:29,080

10
00:00:29,080 --> 00:00:30,910
PROFESSOR: All right.

11
00:00:30,910 --> 00:00:33,970
We'll back up and start again
since I just turned on my

12
00:00:33,970 --> 00:00:35,220
microphone.

13
00:00:35,220 --> 00:00:37,180

14
00:00:37,180 --> 00:00:41,090
I started with the observation
that for most of recorded

15
00:00:41,090 --> 00:00:44,960
history people thought
qualitatively, not

16
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:46,900
quantitatively.

17
00:00:46,900 --> 00:00:49,020
They didn't know what
statistics were.

18
00:00:49,020 --> 00:00:52,590
They must have had some
intuitive sense, for example,

19
00:00:52,590 --> 00:00:56,030
that if you're old, you're
more likely to have bad

20
00:00:56,030 --> 00:00:58,000
hearing than if you're young.

21
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,040
If you're old you're
more likely to die

22
00:01:00,040 --> 00:01:00,940
than if you're young.

23
00:01:00,940 --> 00:01:02,500
Things like that.

24
00:01:02,500 --> 00:01:06,890
But they were just anecdotes,
and they had no careful way to

25
00:01:06,890 --> 00:01:10,170
go from statements about
individuals to statements

26
00:01:10,170 --> 00:01:14,050
about populations
or expectations.

27
00:01:14,050 --> 00:01:18,550
This changed in about the middle
of the 17th century,

28
00:01:18,550 --> 00:01:22,970
changed fairly dramatically,
when an Englishman named John

29
00:01:22,970 --> 00:01:26,380
Graunt published something
called The Natural and

30
00:01:26,380 --> 00:01:32,110
Political Observations Made Upon
the Bills of Mortality.

31
00:01:32,110 --> 00:01:36,990
This was the first work in
recorded history that actually

32
00:01:36,990 --> 00:01:39,050
used statistics.

33
00:01:39,050 --> 00:01:42,540
And what he did is he looked
at the fairly comprehensive

34
00:01:42,540 --> 00:01:47,180
statistics of when people died
in the city of London.

35
00:01:47,180 --> 00:01:51,070
And from that, attempted to
produce a model that could be

36
00:01:51,070 --> 00:01:55,400
used to predict the spread
of the plague.

37
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:58,800
And it turns out, he was
pretty good at it.

38
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:01,530
And that just changed the way
people started to think.

39
00:02:01,530 --> 00:02:06,910
And since that time, people have
used statistics both to

40
00:02:06,910 --> 00:02:09,304
inform and, unfortunately,
to mislead.

41
00:02:09,304 --> 00:02:12,400

42
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:17,840
Some have willfully used
statistics to mislead, others

43
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:20,430
have merely been incompetent.

44
00:02:20,430 --> 00:02:23,760
And that gets me to what I
want to talk about today,

45
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:25,750
which is statistics.

46
00:02:25,750 --> 00:02:29,060

47
00:02:29,060 --> 00:02:32,070
This is often attributed to Mark
Twain but, in fact, he

48
00:02:32,070 --> 00:02:35,750
copied it from Benjamin
Disraeli, who said, "There are

49
00:02:35,750 --> 00:02:43,760
three kinds of lies: lies,
damned lies, and statistics."

50
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:49,840
And there is, unfortunately,
a lot of truth in that.

51
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:53,080
More recently, in the '50s
Darrell Huff wrote a wonderful

52
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:58,030
book, I recommend it, called
How to Lie with Statistics.

53
00:02:58,030 --> 00:03:01,290
Now here's a quote from the
book, "If you can't prove what

54
00:03:01,290 --> 00:03:05,540
you want to prove, demonstrate
something else and pretend

55
00:03:05,540 --> 00:03:07,360
that they're the same thing.

56
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:10,530
In the daze that follows the
collision of statistics with

57
00:03:10,530 --> 00:03:15,270
the human mind, hardly anyone
will notice the difference."

58
00:03:15,270 --> 00:03:19,340
Alas, that seems to be true.

59
00:03:19,340 --> 00:03:24,900
So what I want to do today is
talk about a few ways in which

60
00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:29,230
one can be fooled into drawing
inappropriate conclusions from

61
00:03:29,230 --> 00:03:31,610
statistical data.

62
00:03:31,610 --> 00:03:34,100
Now I trust that you
will use this

63
00:03:34,100 --> 00:03:36,750
information only for good.

64
00:03:36,750 --> 00:03:42,170
And it will make you a better
consumer and purveyor of data

65
00:03:42,170 --> 00:03:46,980
rather than a better liar,
but that's up to you.

66
00:03:46,980 --> 00:03:47,810
All right.

67
00:03:47,810 --> 00:03:52,430
So let's start with the
first way out thing I

68
00:03:52,430 --> 00:03:54,540
want to talk about.

69
00:03:54,540 --> 00:03:59,150
And it's important to always
remember that no matter how

70
00:03:59,150 --> 00:04:08,690
good your statistics are,
statistical measures don't

71
00:04:08,690 --> 00:04:09,940
tell the whole story.

72
00:04:09,940 --> 00:04:12,310

73
00:04:12,310 --> 00:04:15,575
We've seen examples of this
already earlier in the term.

74
00:04:15,575 --> 00:04:19,480

75
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:22,290
There are an enormous set of
statistics that can be

76
00:04:22,290 --> 00:04:24,670
extracted from a data set.

77
00:04:24,670 --> 00:04:28,480
And by carefully picking and
choosing among them, it's

78
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:33,450
possible to convey almost any
impression you want about the

79
00:04:33,450 --> 00:04:35,590
same data set.

80
00:04:35,590 --> 00:04:40,250
The best antidote, of course, is
to look at the data itself.

81
00:04:40,250 --> 00:04:46,320
In 1973, the statistician John
Anscombe published a paper

82
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:50,050
with this set of data.

83
00:04:50,050 --> 00:04:56,760
Four different examples where
he gave values for x and y,

84
00:04:56,760 --> 00:04:59,570
nothing very sophisticated.

85
00:04:59,570 --> 00:05:06,150
The interesting thing is that
in many ways, the statistics

86
00:05:06,150 --> 00:05:09,085
for these four data sets
are very similar.

87
00:05:09,085 --> 00:05:11,730

88
00:05:11,730 --> 00:05:18,980
They have the same mean, the
same median, the same variance

89
00:05:18,980 --> 00:05:24,020
for x and y both, the same
correlation between x and y.

90
00:05:24,020 --> 00:05:28,520
And even if we use linear
regression to get a fit, we

91
00:05:28,520 --> 00:05:30,210
get very similar things.

92
00:05:30,210 --> 00:05:32,070
So let's look at it.

93
00:05:32,070 --> 00:05:36,130
I actually wrote some
code to do that.

94
00:05:36,130 --> 00:05:42,520
So this just reads in the data
set that we just had up, and

95
00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:45,810
then plots some things
with it.

96
00:05:45,810 --> 00:05:47,070
And so let's look at it.

97
00:05:47,070 --> 00:06:01,580

98
00:06:01,580 --> 00:06:05,170
So what you can see is, you have
these in your hand out,

99
00:06:05,170 --> 00:06:08,890
we have four graphs,
four plots.

100
00:06:08,890 --> 00:06:10,920
And I won't show you
them all because

101
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:13,080
they're all are identical.

102
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:17,080
What they all give me is a mean
of 7.5 and a whole bunch

103
00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:23,090
of things, same to 17 decimal
places or so, the same median

104
00:06:23,090 --> 00:06:32,530
and the same linear fit,
y equals 0.5x plus 3.

105
00:06:32,530 --> 00:06:36,550
So I might write a paper in
which I would tell you that

106
00:06:36,550 --> 00:06:39,180
well, from a statistical
sense, these data

107
00:06:39,180 --> 00:06:41,940
sets are all the same.

108
00:06:41,940 --> 00:06:45,840
Every statistical result I
ran said these things are

109
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:47,850
indistinguishable.

110
00:06:47,850 --> 00:06:51,330
Well, is it true that
these data sets are

111
00:06:51,330 --> 00:06:52,580
indistinguishable?

112
00:06:52,580 --> 00:06:55,060

113
00:06:55,060 --> 00:07:02,220
Well, one way to look at it is
to actually plot the points.

114
00:07:02,220 --> 00:07:08,100
So we can run it with true,
which says in addition to

115
00:07:08,100 --> 00:07:12,580
plotting the data, put points
on them in addition to

116
00:07:12,580 --> 00:07:14,750
plotting the statistics.

117
00:07:14,750 --> 00:07:19,120
And now we see something
fairly dramatic.

118
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:24,160
So for example, figure (2) and
figure (1) don't look a lot

119
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:30,130
like each other, when we
actually look at the data.

120
00:07:30,130 --> 00:07:33,890
Figure (3) looks quite different
and figure (4) is

121
00:07:33,890 --> 00:07:36,590
remarkably different.

122
00:07:36,590 --> 00:07:39,300
Compare figure (4) to,
say, figure (1).

123
00:07:39,300 --> 00:07:41,900
Again, these are all
in your hand out.

124
00:07:41,900 --> 00:07:45,810
So the moral is pretty simple
here, and it's one we looked

125
00:07:45,810 --> 00:07:51,820
at before, which is, don't
ever ignore the data.

126
00:07:51,820 --> 00:07:55,310
Don't just look at statistics
about the data, try and find a

127
00:07:55,310 --> 00:07:57,455
way to look at the
data itself.

128
00:07:57,455 --> 00:08:08,060

129
00:08:08,060 --> 00:08:12,610
Of course, it's easy enough to
look at the data, but how do

130
00:08:12,610 --> 00:08:15,190
you look at it?

131
00:08:15,190 --> 00:08:17,390
And the next thing to
remember is that

132
00:08:17,390 --> 00:08:20,990
pictures can be deceiving.

133
00:08:20,990 --> 00:08:27,710

134
00:08:27,710 --> 00:08:31,740
There can be no doubt about the
utility of graphics for

135
00:08:31,740 --> 00:08:34,740
quickly conveying information.

136
00:08:34,740 --> 00:08:39,919
However, when used carelessly or
maliciously, a plot can be

137
00:08:39,919 --> 00:08:42,090
highly misleading.

138
00:08:42,090 --> 00:08:56,570
So let's look-- go back to the
PowerPoint, and look at this

139
00:08:56,570 --> 00:09:01,090
plot of housing prices
in the Midwest.

140
00:09:01,090 --> 00:09:08,830
So we've got a plot here, and
we've got years 2006, 2007 and

141
00:09:08,830 --> 00:09:12,400
then in 2008 and 9,
we have quarters.

142
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:15,170
You may remember that there was
an event in the housing

143
00:09:15,170 --> 00:09:21,000
market in 2008 precipitating the
global financial crisis.

144
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:24,960
And if we look at this, what
impression do we get about

145
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:29,060
housing prices in the mid
west during this period?

146
00:09:29,060 --> 00:09:32,450
Well I would get the impression
that they are

147
00:09:32,450 --> 00:09:35,360
remarkably stable.

148
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:38,220
You publish this and you say,
OK, look they really haven't

149
00:09:38,220 --> 00:09:39,210
changed very much.

150
00:09:39,210 --> 00:09:42,180
Maybe they've gone down
a little, but

151
00:09:42,180 --> 00:09:45,490
nothing very serious.

152
00:09:45,490 --> 00:09:50,560
If we compare that to this plot,
which is exactly the

153
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:56,980
same data, and now I ask
you about housing

154
00:09:56,980 --> 00:09:58,240
prices in the Midwest.

155
00:09:58,240 --> 00:09:59,960
Well, what you might
tell me is it's--

156
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:03,630
they're remarkably unstable.

157
00:10:03,630 --> 00:10:08,440
And in fact, there was
clearly some sort of

158
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:11,460
horrible event here.

159
00:10:11,460 --> 00:10:15,140
Exactly the same data, two
plots both of which are

160
00:10:15,140 --> 00:10:19,460
truthful, but which give a
radically different impression

161
00:10:19,460 --> 00:10:20,710
about what happened.

162
00:10:20,710 --> 00:10:23,320

163
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:25,680
The chart on the right
was designed--

164
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:27,440
on the right in your handout--

165
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:31,660
was designed to show that they
were highly unstable.

166
00:10:31,660 --> 00:10:32,930
So what's the difference?

167
00:10:32,930 --> 00:10:36,110
What trick did I use to produce
these two plots?

168
00:10:36,110 --> 00:10:36,580
Yeah?

169
00:10:36,580 --> 00:10:39,002
AUDIENCE: In the more
stable one, you used

170
00:10:39,002 --> 00:10:39,990
the logarithmic scale.

171
00:10:39,990 --> 00:10:43,942
And then here only has
selected numbers so--

172
00:10:43,942 --> 00:10:45,660
PROFESSOR: So that
was certainly one

173
00:10:45,660 --> 00:10:47,310
trick that I performed.

174
00:10:47,310 --> 00:10:50,750
That in the first chart,
I plotted the y-axis

175
00:10:50,750 --> 00:10:53,460
logarithmically, which always
make things look like they are

176
00:10:53,460 --> 00:10:56,990
changing less than if
I plot it linearly.

177
00:10:56,990 --> 00:11:00,100
And in this chart, I
used a linear plot.

178
00:11:00,100 --> 00:11:00,850
Go ahead.

179
00:11:00,850 --> 00:11:02,870
AUDIENCE: You see a much
narrower scale

180
00:11:02,870 --> 00:11:03,370
on the second plot.

181
00:11:03,370 --> 00:11:07,230
So that the magnitude of the
difference is much less

182
00:11:07,230 --> 00:11:09,630
compared to the magnitude of the
whole graph of the scale.

183
00:11:09,630 --> 00:11:14,370
PROFESSOR: So that's the other
thing I did is, if you look at

184
00:11:14,370 --> 00:11:18,480
it, I sort of cheated.

185
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:23,200
I had full years here and
then I went to quarters.

186
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:28,160
So in part of my chart, the
resolution on the x is pretty

187
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:32,750
wide is a whole year, and then
part of it's on a quarter.

188
00:11:32,750 --> 00:11:36,260
And, not surprisingly, since
we know that housing prices

189
00:11:36,260 --> 00:11:40,020
change seasonally, they're
different in the spring than

190
00:11:40,020 --> 00:11:44,040
in the winter, once I start
plotting quarters, even if

191
00:11:44,040 --> 00:11:47,150
there had not been a crash, it
would have looked much less

192
00:11:47,150 --> 00:11:51,430
stable in the out years,
because I changed the

193
00:11:51,430 --> 00:11:55,270
resolution on the x-axis.

194
00:11:55,270 --> 00:11:56,600
I didn't lie.

195
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:59,620
You can tell reading the
legend that I did that.

196
00:11:59,620 --> 00:12:01,810
But I sure could have
fooled a lot of

197
00:12:01,810 --> 00:12:03,060
people with these charts.

198
00:12:03,060 --> 00:12:06,120

199
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:10,150
Here's another nice example
of statistics.

200
00:12:10,150 --> 00:12:11,950
So this plots--

201
00:12:11,950 --> 00:12:18,670
this is from a paper by two
professors, I think from Yale,

202
00:12:18,670 --> 00:12:22,800
shows what you can do if you're
in the Ivy league, that

203
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:28,750
plots initials against GPA
for students at Yale.

204
00:12:28,750 --> 00:12:31,420

205
00:12:31,420 --> 00:12:34,890
And so you can see that if your
first name starts with

206
00:12:34,890 --> 00:12:38,860
the letter A, I think it was
first initials, your GPA is

207
00:12:38,860 --> 00:12:44,410
considerably higher than if it
starts with C or D. And if

208
00:12:44,410 --> 00:12:47,140
your parents weren't nice enough
to give you an A name,

209
00:12:47,140 --> 00:12:49,930
you could hope they at least
gave you a B name.

210
00:12:49,930 --> 00:12:51,400
And you certainly don't
want them to give

211
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:52,630
you a C or a D name.

212
00:12:52,630 --> 00:12:58,520
So if you're Charlene or David
you could have a real problem.

213
00:12:58,520 --> 00:13:01,730
I have to say my first child
was named David.

214
00:13:01,730 --> 00:13:05,600
His GPA might have been
somewhere in there.

215
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:06,670
All right --

216
00:13:06,670 --> 00:13:08,170
clearly it matters.

217
00:13:08,170 --> 00:13:12,578
Well, what tricks did
I perform here?

218
00:13:12,578 --> 00:13:15,063
AUDIENCE: There is very
little disparity in x.

219
00:13:15,063 --> 00:13:19,715
You are going from 3.32 to--

220
00:13:19,715 --> 00:13:20,620
PROFESSOR: Right.

221
00:13:20,620 --> 00:13:24,770
So what I did here is I made the
range on the y-axis very

222
00:13:24,770 --> 00:13:32,500
small, ranging from 3.32 to
3.38, not a big difference.

223
00:13:32,500 --> 00:13:35,890
However, because that's the
whole thing, it looks like

224
00:13:35,890 --> 00:13:37,140
it's a big difference.

225
00:13:37,140 --> 00:13:40,480

226
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:43,120
You will often see this when
you, say, look at things in

227
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:47,510
newspapers where, in fact,
someone has manipulated one of

228
00:13:47,510 --> 00:13:51,880
the axes to make things
look big or small.

229
00:13:51,880 --> 00:13:57,430
If I had ranged this from a GPA
of 0.0 to a GPA of 4.0,

230
00:13:57,430 --> 00:14:01,210
the highest GPA at Yale,
this difference would

231
00:14:01,210 --> 00:14:04,520
have looked very tiny.

232
00:14:04,520 --> 00:14:05,440
But I didn't --

233
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:08,060
actually it wasn't I. I actually
copied this from

234
00:14:08,060 --> 00:14:09,170
their paper.

235
00:14:09,170 --> 00:14:13,150
This was the way they presented
it in their paper.

236
00:14:13,150 --> 00:14:15,880
Because they were trying to
argue in the paper that your

237
00:14:15,880 --> 00:14:18,670
name had a big influence
on your life.

238
00:14:18,670 --> 00:14:21,870
And they used many statistics
including your grades.

239
00:14:21,870 --> 00:14:26,340
And so they actually formatted
it kind of like this to try

240
00:14:26,340 --> 00:14:28,580
and give you this impression.

241
00:14:28,580 --> 00:14:33,770
Now later we'll see another
statistical sin they committed

242
00:14:33,770 --> 00:14:38,070
in this paper, which, basically,
was designed to

243
00:14:38,070 --> 00:14:42,890
show that in your name
was destiny.

244
00:14:42,890 --> 00:14:45,380
And they had many
other things.

245
00:14:45,380 --> 00:14:47,850
If you're a baseball player, and
your name starts with K,

246
00:14:47,850 --> 00:14:50,650
you're more likely
to strike out.

247
00:14:50,650 --> 00:14:53,200
Because K is the symbol for
strikeouts in a baseball score

248
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:57,460
book, a lot of implausible
things.

249
00:14:57,460 --> 00:14:58,870
All right.

250
00:14:58,870 --> 00:15:05,850
Moving right along, probably
the most serious and common

251
00:15:05,850 --> 00:15:10,150
statistical error is
the one known as

252
00:15:10,150 --> 00:15:13,030
Garbage In Garbage Out.

253
00:15:13,030 --> 00:15:17,180

254
00:15:17,180 --> 00:15:22,700
And it's so common that people
typically refer to it by its

255
00:15:22,700 --> 00:15:26,880
acronym GIGO --

256
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:30,550
Garbage In Garbage Out.

257
00:15:30,550 --> 00:15:34,610
A classic example of this
occurred and, we could look at

258
00:15:34,610 --> 00:15:36,680
more recent examples,
but I don't want to

259
00:15:36,680 --> 00:15:38,930
offend any of you.

260
00:15:38,930 --> 00:15:45,670
In 1840, United states census
showed that insanity among

261
00:15:45,670 --> 00:15:50,750
free blacks and mulattoes was
roughly 10 times more common

262
00:15:50,750 --> 00:15:56,360
than insanity among enslaved
blacks or mulattoes.

263
00:15:56,360 --> 00:16:00,900
And the conclusion from this
was obvious, I guess.

264
00:16:00,900 --> 00:16:04,500
US Senator, former Vice
President, and later,

265
00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:08,870
Secretary of State John C.
Calhoun concluded from the

266
00:16:08,870 --> 00:16:13,040
census and I quote, "The data
on sanity revealed In this

267
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:15,500
census is unimpeachable.

268
00:16:15,500 --> 00:16:18,340
From it, our nation must
conclude that the abolition of

269
00:16:18,340 --> 00:16:22,770
slavery would be to the African,
a curse." Because

270
00:16:22,770 --> 00:16:24,960
after all, if you freed them
from slavery, they

271
00:16:24,960 --> 00:16:26,210
would all go insane.

272
00:16:26,210 --> 00:16:28,620

273
00:16:28,620 --> 00:16:31,550
That's what the statistics
reported, he said.

274
00:16:31,550 --> 00:16:36,310
Now never mind it was soon clear
that in fact that census

275
00:16:36,310 --> 00:16:38,760
was riddled with errors.

276
00:16:38,760 --> 00:16:42,610
And John Quincy Adams, a former
Vice President and

277
00:16:42,610 --> 00:16:47,350
Massachusetts resident responded
to Calhoun and said,

278
00:16:47,350 --> 00:16:48,950
no that's a ridiculous
conclusion.

279
00:16:48,950 --> 00:16:51,660
The census is full of errors.

280
00:16:51,660 --> 00:16:56,680
Calhoun, being a very patient
person, explained to Adams the

281
00:16:56,680 --> 00:17:03,900
following, "There were so many
errors, that they balanced one

282
00:17:03,900 --> 00:17:07,520
another out, and led to the same
conclusion just as much

283
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:10,970
as if they were all correct."
There were just enough errors

284
00:17:10,970 --> 00:17:13,800
that you could be OK.

285
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:16,640
Well, what was he relying on?

286
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:19,950
What should he have said if he
wanted to make this statement

287
00:17:19,950 --> 00:17:23,300
more mathematically precise?

288
00:17:23,300 --> 00:17:26,910
What he was basically implying
is that the measurement errors

289
00:17:26,910 --> 00:17:32,190
are unbiased and independent of
each other and, therefore,

290
00:17:32,190 --> 00:17:37,230
almost identically distributed
on either side of the mean.

291
00:17:37,230 --> 00:17:39,140
I see a typo, I might
as well fix it.

292
00:17:39,140 --> 00:17:44,030

293
00:17:44,030 --> 00:17:45,720
Might as well make it big
enough to fix it.

294
00:17:45,720 --> 00:17:54,770

295
00:17:54,770 --> 00:17:56,020
That's interesting.

296
00:17:56,020 --> 00:18:00,540

297
00:18:00,540 --> 00:18:05,400
If he had made this much more
precise statement, then you

298
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:08,090
could have had an meaningful
discussion--

299
00:18:08,090 --> 00:18:10,210
assuming it was possible to have
a meaningful discussion

300
00:18:10,210 --> 00:18:14,940
with John Calhoun, which
is perhaps dubious--

301
00:18:14,940 --> 00:18:19,910
about whether or not, in fact,
the errors are independent.

302
00:18:19,910 --> 00:18:23,600
Because if they're not, if, for
example, they represent

303
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:28,600
bias in the people compiling the
data, then you cannot rely

304
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:31,480
upon statistical methods
to say that they'll

305
00:18:31,480 --> 00:18:34,030
balance each other out.

306
00:18:34,030 --> 00:18:38,080
You remember way back in Gauss'
time, Gauss talked

307
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:41,600
about this when he talked about
the normal distribution.

308
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:44,130
And said, well, if we take
these astronomical

309
00:18:44,130 --> 00:18:48,450
measurements and we assume our
errors are independent and

310
00:18:48,450 --> 00:18:53,130
normally distributed, then we
can look at the mean and

311
00:18:53,130 --> 00:18:55,425
assume that that's close
to the truth.

312
00:18:55,425 --> 00:18:58,190

313
00:18:58,190 --> 00:19:01,890
Well, those are important
assumptions which in this case

314
00:19:01,890 --> 00:19:04,490
turned out to be not correct.

315
00:19:04,490 --> 00:19:07,340

316
00:19:07,340 --> 00:19:10,940
And, in fact, it was later shown
that the errors did not

317
00:19:10,940 --> 00:19:13,570
balance each other out nicely.

318
00:19:13,570 --> 00:19:17,840
And in fact, today you can say
that no statistical conclusion

319
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:19,930
can be drawn from that.

320
00:19:19,930 --> 00:19:23,460
On the other hand recently,
the US National Research

321
00:19:23,460 --> 00:19:27,180
Council, perhaps the most
prestigious academic

322
00:19:27,180 --> 00:19:31,130
organization in the United
states, published a ranking of

323
00:19:31,130 --> 00:19:33,920
all universities
in the country.

324
00:19:33,920 --> 00:19:39,590
And it was later shown that it
was full of garbagy input.

325
00:19:39,590 --> 00:19:42,810
And they did extensive
statistical analysis and

326
00:19:42,810 --> 00:19:48,800
published it on data that turned
out to be just wrong.

327
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:52,770
And it was very embarrassing.

328
00:19:52,770 --> 00:19:54,740
Now the good news is
MIT came out near

329
00:19:54,740 --> 00:19:57,710
the top of this analysis.

330
00:19:57,710 --> 00:20:00,130
And the bad news is we can't
conclude that it actually

331
00:20:00,130 --> 00:20:02,940
should have been near the top
because who knows about the

332
00:20:02,940 --> 00:20:07,560
quality of the data, but
kind of embarrassing.

333
00:20:07,560 --> 00:20:08,760
All right.

334
00:20:08,760 --> 00:20:14,320
Moving right along, another very
common way to lie with

335
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:21,890
statistics is to exploit what's
called the cum hoc ergo

336
00:20:21,890 --> 00:20:29,520
propter hoc fallacy.

337
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:34,450

338
00:20:34,450 --> 00:20:37,550
So anyone here study Latin?

339
00:20:37,550 --> 00:20:40,690

340
00:20:40,690 --> 00:20:41,240
Bunch of techy--

341
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:41,930
Oh OK.

342
00:20:41,930 --> 00:20:42,900
Well what does it mean?

343
00:20:42,900 --> 00:20:45,546
AUDIENCE: With this therefore,
because of this?

344
00:20:45,546 --> 00:20:48,410
PROFESSOR: Boy, your
Latin is good.

345
00:20:48,410 --> 00:20:51,120
Either that or you just
know statistics.

346
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:55,940
But I have to say that was the
most fluent translation I've

347
00:20:55,940 --> 00:21:00,040
had it all the years I've
asked this question.

348
00:21:00,040 --> 00:21:02,980
I hit the relay man-- the relay
woman on the throw.

349
00:21:02,980 --> 00:21:03,700
All right.

350
00:21:03,700 --> 00:21:08,660
Yes, with this, therefore
because of this.

351
00:21:08,660 --> 00:21:11,440
I don't know why but
statisticians, like physicians

352
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:13,160
and attorneys, like
to show off by

353
00:21:13,160 --> 00:21:16,210
phrasing things in Latin.

354
00:21:16,210 --> 00:21:21,280
So for example, it is a
statistical fact that college

355
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:25,320
students, including MIT
students, who regularly attend

356
00:21:25,320 --> 00:21:29,970
lectures have higher GPAs than
students who attend lectures

357
00:21:29,970 --> 00:21:32,200
only sporadically.

358
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:36,010
So that would tell us that those
of you in the room are

359
00:21:36,010 --> 00:21:39,140
likely to have a higher GPA than
the various students in

360
00:21:39,140 --> 00:21:42,180
6.00 who are not in this room.

361
00:21:42,180 --> 00:21:44,850
I hope it's true.

362
00:21:44,850 --> 00:21:48,030
Now if you're a professor who
gives these lectures, what you

363
00:21:48,030 --> 00:21:51,260
want to believe it's because the
lectures are so incredibly

364
00:21:51,260 --> 00:21:54,630
informative, that we make the
students who come much smarter

365
00:21:54,630 --> 00:21:56,540
and, therefore, they
do better.

366
00:21:56,540 --> 00:21:59,170
And so we'd like to
assume causality.

367
00:21:59,170 --> 00:22:01,970
Because I give beautiful
lectures and you choose to

368
00:22:01,970 --> 00:22:05,800
come, you will get a better
grade in 6.00.

369
00:22:05,800 --> 00:22:09,310
Well, yes, there's
a correlation.

370
00:22:09,310 --> 00:22:16,290
It's unquestionably true, but
causation is hard to jump to.

371
00:22:16,290 --> 00:22:20,700
For example, maybe it's the
point that students who bother

372
00:22:20,700 --> 00:22:24,910
to come to lecture also bother
to do the problem sets, and

373
00:22:24,910 --> 00:22:27,540
are just more conscientious.

374
00:22:27,540 --> 00:22:30,070
And whether they came to lecture
or not, the fact that

375
00:22:30,070 --> 00:22:33,650
they're more conscientious would
give them better GPAs.

376
00:22:33,650 --> 00:22:37,650
There's no way I know to
separate those two things,

377
00:22:37,650 --> 00:22:40,150
other than doing a controlled
experiment, right?

378
00:22:40,150 --> 00:22:43,410
Maybe kicking half of you out of
lecture every day and just

379
00:22:43,410 --> 00:22:45,020
see how it goes.

380
00:22:45,020 --> 00:22:49,140
But it's dangerous but again,
you can read things like the

381
00:22:49,140 --> 00:22:53,300
faculty newsletter, which will
talk about how important it is

382
00:22:53,300 --> 00:22:55,930
to come the lecture because
you'll do better.

383
00:22:55,930 --> 00:22:58,920
Because whoever wrote that
article for the faculty

384
00:22:58,920 --> 00:23:01,390
newsletter didn't understand
this--

385
00:23:01,390 --> 00:23:04,750
this fallacy, or was just
thinking wishfully.

386
00:23:04,750 --> 00:23:07,300

387
00:23:07,300 --> 00:23:11,120
Another nice example, one that
was in the news not too long

388
00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:13,185
ago, has to do with the flu.

389
00:23:13,185 --> 00:23:16,090

390
00:23:16,090 --> 00:23:19,980
This was the cases of
flu in New York

391
00:23:19,980 --> 00:23:23,400
State in recent years.

392
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:27,140
And you'll notice that there was
a peak in 2009, and that

393
00:23:27,140 --> 00:23:30,970
was the famous swine flu
epidemic, which I'm sure you

394
00:23:30,970 --> 00:23:33,220
all remember.

395
00:23:33,220 --> 00:23:36,780
Now, if you look at this
carefully, or even not too

396
00:23:36,780 --> 00:23:41,500
carefully, you'll notice a
correlation between when

397
00:23:41,500 --> 00:23:48,480
schools are in session and
when the flu occurs.

398
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:51,760
That in fact, during those
months when schools are in

399
00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:56,810
session, there are more cases of
flu than in the months when

400
00:23:56,810 --> 00:24:02,890
school is not in session, high
schools, colleges, whatever.

401
00:24:02,890 --> 00:24:06,070
Quite a strong correlation,
in fact.

402
00:24:06,070 --> 00:24:10,670
This led many to conclude that
going to school is an

403
00:24:10,670 --> 00:24:13,350
important causative factor
in getting the flu.

404
00:24:13,350 --> 00:24:16,100

405
00:24:16,100 --> 00:24:19,410
And so maybe you shouldn't
have come to the lectures

406
00:24:19,410 --> 00:24:22,410
because you would have just
gotten the flu by doing so.

407
00:24:22,410 --> 00:24:26,430
And in fact because of this,
you had many parents not

408
00:24:26,430 --> 00:24:30,190
sending their kids to school
during the swine flu epidemic.

409
00:24:30,190 --> 00:24:33,470
And in fact, you had many
schools closing in some

410
00:24:33,470 --> 00:24:36,265
communities because of the
swine flu epidemic.

411
00:24:36,265 --> 00:24:39,460

412
00:24:39,460 --> 00:24:42,720
Well, let's think about it.

413
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:46,570
Just as you could use this
correlation to conclude that

414
00:24:46,570 --> 00:24:51,380
going to school causes the swine
flu, you could have also

415
00:24:51,380 --> 00:24:56,930
used it to prove that the flu
causes you to go to school.

416
00:24:56,930 --> 00:25:00,340
Because more people are in
school when the flu season is

417
00:25:00,340 --> 00:25:01,440
at it's height.

418
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:04,310
And therefore, it's the growth
of flu that causes people to

419
00:25:04,310 --> 00:25:06,320
go to school.

420
00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:08,340
That's an equally valid
statistical

421
00:25:08,340 --> 00:25:09,590
assumption from this data.

422
00:25:09,590 --> 00:25:12,150

423
00:25:12,150 --> 00:25:15,250
Kind of a weird thing but
it's true, right?

424
00:25:15,250 --> 00:25:19,150
Just as we could conclude that
having a high GPA causes

425
00:25:19,150 --> 00:25:20,750
people to come to the lecture.

426
00:25:20,750 --> 00:25:22,790
You look at your GPA every
morning, and if it's high

427
00:25:22,790 --> 00:25:25,890
enough, you come to lecture,
otherwise, you don't.

428
00:25:25,890 --> 00:25:29,880
You could draw that conclusion
from the data as well.

429
00:25:29,880 --> 00:25:34,630
The issue here that you have to
think about is whether or

430
00:25:34,630 --> 00:25:42,920
not there is what's called a
lurking variable, some other

431
00:25:42,920 --> 00:25:48,020
variable that's related to the
other two, and maybe that's

432
00:25:48,020 --> 00:25:49,830
the causative one.

433
00:25:49,830 --> 00:25:55,520
So for example, a lurking
variable here is that the

434
00:25:55,520 --> 00:26:01,560
school season coincides with
or the non-school season,

435
00:26:01,560 --> 00:26:03,920
maybe I should say, coincides
with the summer.

436
00:26:03,920 --> 00:26:07,770

437
00:26:07,770 --> 00:26:14,860
And in fact, if you study the
flu virus in a lab, you will

438
00:26:14,860 --> 00:26:19,900
discover that it survives longer
in cold weather than in

439
00:26:19,900 --> 00:26:22,270
hot and humid weather.

440
00:26:22,270 --> 00:26:26,390
When it's cold and dry, the flu
virus will survive for a

441
00:26:26,390 --> 00:26:30,120
longer time on a surface
than it will when

442
00:26:30,120 --> 00:26:32,860
it's warm and humid.

443
00:26:32,860 --> 00:26:37,530
And so in fact, maybe it's the
weather, not the presence of

444
00:26:37,530 --> 00:26:42,120
schools, that causes the flu
to be more virulent during

445
00:26:42,120 --> 00:26:44,350
certain times of the year.

446
00:26:44,350 --> 00:26:48,950
In fact, it's probably
likely true.

447
00:26:48,950 --> 00:26:52,180
So there is a lurking variable
that we have to consider, and

448
00:26:52,180 --> 00:26:55,870
maybe that's the causative
factor.

449
00:26:55,870 --> 00:27:03,060
Now, this can actually lead
to some really bad

450
00:27:03,060 --> 00:27:06,230
decisions in the world.

451
00:27:06,230 --> 00:27:09,100
I'm particularly interested in
issues related to health care

452
00:27:09,100 --> 00:27:12,390
and public health.

453
00:27:12,390 --> 00:27:18,470
In 2002, roughly 6 million
American women were taking

454
00:27:18,470 --> 00:27:24,450
hormone replacement therapy, in
the belief that this would

455
00:27:24,450 --> 00:27:30,310
substantially lower their risk
of cardiovascular disease.

456
00:27:30,310 --> 00:27:34,810
It was argued that women over a
certain age or of a certain

457
00:27:34,810 --> 00:27:37,620
age, if you took extra hormones,
they were less

458
00:27:37,620 --> 00:27:40,200
likely to have a heart attack.

459
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:45,880
This belief was supported by
several published studies in

460
00:27:45,880 --> 00:27:50,720
highly reputable journals in
which they showed a strong

461
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:55,780
correlation between being on
hormone replacement therapy

462
00:27:55,780 --> 00:28:00,930
and not having cardiovascular
disease.

463
00:28:00,930 --> 00:28:04,650
And this data had been around
a while and, as I said, by

464
00:28:04,650 --> 00:28:08,190
2002 in the US, roughly
6 million women

465
00:28:08,190 --> 00:28:10,470
were on this therapy.

466
00:28:10,470 --> 00:28:13,960
Later that year, the Journal
of the American Medical

467
00:28:13,960 --> 00:28:19,440
Society published an article
asserting that in fact being

468
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:22,290
on this therapy increased
women's risk of

469
00:28:22,290 --> 00:28:25,990
cardiovascular disease.

470
00:28:25,990 --> 00:28:29,616
It made you more likely to
have a heart attack.

471
00:28:29,616 --> 00:28:33,170
Well, how could this
have happened?

472
00:28:33,170 --> 00:28:37,900
After the new study came out,
people went back and

473
00:28:37,900 --> 00:28:43,600
reanalyzed the old study and
discovered that the women in

474
00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:47,690
that study who'd been on hormone
replacement therapy

475
00:28:47,690 --> 00:28:51,660
were more likely than the other
women in the group to

476
00:28:51,660 --> 00:28:58,900
have also better diet and be on
a better exercise regimen.

477
00:28:58,900 --> 00:29:01,335
In fact, they were women who
were more health conscious.

478
00:29:01,335 --> 00:29:04,350

479
00:29:04,350 --> 00:29:08,330
So there were the lurking
variables of diet and exercise

480
00:29:08,330 --> 00:29:13,120
and other things that were, in
fact, probably the causative

481
00:29:13,120 --> 00:29:18,030
factors in better health, not
the replacement therapy.

482
00:29:18,030 --> 00:29:20,540
But there was this lurking
variable that had not been

483
00:29:20,540 --> 00:29:24,950
discovered in the initial
analysis of the data.

484
00:29:24,950 --> 00:29:30,350
So what we saw is that taking
hormone replacement therapy

485
00:29:30,350 --> 00:29:35,010
and improved cardiac health were
coincident effects of a

486
00:29:35,010 --> 00:29:38,565
common cause, that is to say
being health conscious.

487
00:29:38,565 --> 00:29:41,280

488
00:29:41,280 --> 00:29:46,270
Kind of a strange thing but
a true and sad story.

489
00:29:46,270 --> 00:29:47,620
All right.

490
00:29:47,620 --> 00:29:57,520
Moving right along, another
thing to be cautious of is

491
00:29:57,520 --> 00:30:07,370
non-response bias and
related problem of a

492
00:30:07,370 --> 00:30:08,815
non-representative sample.

493
00:30:08,815 --> 00:30:18,870

494
00:30:18,870 --> 00:30:22,010
You'll probably recall that when
I first started talking

495
00:30:22,010 --> 00:30:27,510
about statistics and the use of
randomness, I said that all

496
00:30:27,510 --> 00:30:32,400
statistical techniques are based
upon the assumption that

497
00:30:32,400 --> 00:30:36,940
by sampling a subset of a
population, we can infer

498
00:30:36,940 --> 00:30:39,205
things about the population
as a whole.

499
00:30:39,205 --> 00:30:45,190

500
00:30:45,190 --> 00:30:50,970
And that's true, typically,
because if random sampling is

501
00:30:50,970 --> 00:30:55,610
used, you can make assumptions
that the distribution of

502
00:30:55,610 --> 00:30:59,730
results from the random sample,
if it's large enough,

503
00:30:59,730 --> 00:31:02,490
will be the same as a
distribution of results from

504
00:31:02,490 --> 00:31:05,100
the whole population.

505
00:31:05,100 --> 00:31:09,290
And that's why we typically
want to sample randomly.

506
00:31:09,290 --> 00:31:13,190
And so for all the simulations
we looked at, we used random

507
00:31:13,190 --> 00:31:18,120
sampling to try and ensure that
a small number of samples

508
00:31:18,120 --> 00:31:19,740
would give us something
representative of the

509
00:31:19,740 --> 00:31:21,530
population.

510
00:31:21,530 --> 00:31:24,500
And then we use statistical
techniques to answer the

511
00:31:24,500 --> 00:31:29,120
question about how many random
samples we needed.

512
00:31:29,120 --> 00:31:33,620
But those techniques were only
valid if the samples were

513
00:31:33,620 --> 00:31:37,350
indeed random.

514
00:31:37,350 --> 00:31:41,190
Otherwise, you can analyze it
to your heart's content and

515
00:31:41,190 --> 00:31:47,060
any conclusions you've drawn are
likely to be fallacious.

516
00:31:47,060 --> 00:31:51,330
Unfortunately, many studies,
particularly in the social

517
00:31:51,330 --> 00:31:56,730
sciences, are based on
what is often called

518
00:31:56,730 --> 00:31:58,395
a convenience sampling.

519
00:31:58,395 --> 00:32:11,360

520
00:32:11,360 --> 00:32:14,350
So for example, if you look
at psychological--

521
00:32:14,350 --> 00:32:17,480
psychology journals, you'll find
that many psychological

522
00:32:17,480 --> 00:32:19,570
studies use populations of

523
00:32:19,570 --> 00:32:22,830
undergraduates for their studies.

524
00:32:22,830 --> 00:32:24,830
Why did they do this?

525
00:32:24,830 --> 00:32:27,160
Is it because they believe
that undergraduates are

526
00:32:27,160 --> 00:32:30,380
representative of the population
as a whole?

527
00:32:30,380 --> 00:32:30,730
No.

528
00:32:30,730 --> 00:32:32,460
It's because they're captive.

529
00:32:32,460 --> 00:32:36,350
They have to agree to
participate, right?

530
00:32:36,350 --> 00:32:39,300
It's a convenience if you happen
to be at a university

531
00:32:39,300 --> 00:32:43,030
to do your experiments
on undergraduates.

532
00:32:43,030 --> 00:32:45,710
And so they do that and then
they say, well, the

533
00:32:45,710 --> 00:32:50,290
undergraduates are just like
the population as a whole.

534
00:32:50,290 --> 00:32:53,300
You may have observed that at
least at this institution, the

535
00:32:53,300 --> 00:32:56,070
undergraduates are probably
not representative of the

536
00:32:56,070 --> 00:32:57,320
population as a whole.

537
00:32:57,320 --> 00:33:00,960

538
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:04,780
A well-known example of what you
can do with this occurred

539
00:33:04,780 --> 00:33:07,160
during World War II.

540
00:33:07,160 --> 00:33:11,000
Whenever an allied plane would
return from a bombing run over

541
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:17,390
Germany, the plane would be
inspected to see where flak

542
00:33:17,390 --> 00:33:17,970
had hit it.

543
00:33:17,970 --> 00:33:22,070
So the planes would fly over
to drop bombs, the Germans

544
00:33:22,070 --> 00:33:25,320
would shoot flak at the planes
to try and knock

545
00:33:25,320 --> 00:33:26,690
them out the air.

546
00:33:26,690 --> 00:33:29,590
They'd come back to England,
they'd get inspected, they'd

547
00:33:29,590 --> 00:33:32,350
say, well the flak hit this part
of the plane more often

548
00:33:32,350 --> 00:33:34,820
than that part of the
plane on average.

549
00:33:34,820 --> 00:33:39,020
And so they would reinforce the
skin of those parts of the

550
00:33:39,020 --> 00:33:43,370
plane where they expected the
flak to hit, to try and make

551
00:33:43,370 --> 00:33:47,230
the plane less likely to be
damaged in future runs, or the

552
00:33:47,230 --> 00:33:48,500
planes in general.

553
00:33:48,500 --> 00:33:50,860
What's wrong with this?

554
00:33:50,860 --> 00:33:51,200
Yeah?

555
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:55,030
AUDIENCE: They're not getting
the planes that dropped?

556
00:33:55,030 --> 00:33:56,840
PROFESSOR: Exactly.

557
00:33:56,840 --> 00:34:00,170
What they're not sampling is the
planes that never made it

558
00:34:00,170 --> 00:34:04,020
back from the bombing, ooh, that
never made it back from

559
00:34:04,020 --> 00:34:11,389
the bombing runs because they
weren't there to sample.

560
00:34:11,389 --> 00:34:15,150
And in fact maybe it's the case
that what they were doing

561
00:34:15,150 --> 00:34:17,699
was reinforcing those parts of
the planes where it didn't

562
00:34:17,699 --> 00:34:20,150
matter if you got hit by flak
because it wouldn't cause a

563
00:34:20,150 --> 00:34:23,610
plane to crash, and not
reinforcing those parts of the

564
00:34:23,610 --> 00:34:26,360
planes that were most
vulnerable to

565
00:34:26,360 --> 00:34:29,100
being damaged by flak.

566
00:34:29,100 --> 00:34:31,080
They did a convenient
sampling, they drew

567
00:34:31,080 --> 00:34:34,429
conclusions, and they probably
did exactly the wrong thing in

568
00:34:34,429 --> 00:34:36,844
what they chose to reinforce
in the airplanes.

569
00:34:36,844 --> 00:34:39,650

570
00:34:39,650 --> 00:34:46,659
This particular error is called
non-response bias where

571
00:34:46,659 --> 00:34:51,010
you do some sort of survey, for
example, and some people

572
00:34:51,010 --> 00:34:56,980
don't respond and, therefore,
you ignore what

573
00:34:56,980 --> 00:34:58,230
they would have said.

574
00:34:58,230 --> 00:35:00,635

575
00:35:00,635 --> 00:35:03,530
It's perhaps something we see
when we do the underground

576
00:35:03,530 --> 00:35:05,610
guide to Course 6.

577
00:35:05,610 --> 00:35:08,830
In fact I should point out
that it's now online.

578
00:35:08,830 --> 00:35:12,460
And it would be good if each of
you would go and rate this

579
00:35:12,460 --> 00:35:16,210
course, rate the lectures,
rate the TAs, et cetera.

580
00:35:16,210 --> 00:35:18,560
We actually do read them and it
makes a difference in how

581
00:35:18,560 --> 00:35:21,300
we teach the course in
subsequent terms.

582
00:35:21,300 --> 00:35:23,650
But there's clearly a bias.

583
00:35:23,650 --> 00:35:26,090
You know, maybe only the
people who really feel

584
00:35:26,090 --> 00:35:28,570
strongly about the course,
either positively or

585
00:35:28,570 --> 00:35:31,720
negatively, bother to
fill out the survey.

586
00:35:31,720 --> 00:35:34,180
And we draw the conclusions
that there's a bimodal

587
00:35:34,180 --> 00:35:37,570
distribution, and nobody thinks
it's kind of mediocre,

588
00:35:37,570 --> 00:35:40,010
because they don't bother
responding.

589
00:35:40,010 --> 00:35:42,570
Or maybe only the people who
hate the course respond, and

590
00:35:42,570 --> 00:35:44,520
we think everybody
hates the course.

591
00:35:44,520 --> 00:35:45,690
Who knows.

592
00:35:45,690 --> 00:35:48,590
It's a big problem.

593
00:35:48,590 --> 00:35:52,340
We see it, it's a big problem
today with telephone polls,

594
00:35:52,340 --> 00:35:54,970
where you get more convenient
sampling and

595
00:35:54,970 --> 00:35:58,830
non-representative samples,
where a lot of polls are done

596
00:35:58,830 --> 00:36:00,970
using telephones.

597
00:36:00,970 --> 00:36:06,410
By law, these pollsters cannot
call cell phones, so they only

598
00:36:06,410 --> 00:36:07,500
call land lines.

599
00:36:07,500 --> 00:36:11,060
How many of you have
a land line?

600
00:36:11,060 --> 00:36:13,390
Let the record show, nobody.

601
00:36:13,390 --> 00:36:16,800
How many of your parents
have a land line?

602
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:20,290
Let the record show, pretty
much everybody.

603
00:36:20,290 --> 00:36:23,340
Well, that means your parents
are more likely to get sampled

604
00:36:23,340 --> 00:36:27,220
than you when there's a poll
of, say, who should be

605
00:36:27,220 --> 00:36:29,530
nominated for president.

606
00:36:29,530 --> 00:36:32,020
And so any of these polls
that are based on

607
00:36:32,020 --> 00:36:34,740
telephones will be biased.

608
00:36:34,740 --> 00:36:37,910
And, unfortunately, their poll
may just say, a telephone

609
00:36:37,910 --> 00:36:40,250
sample, and people may
not realize the

610
00:36:40,250 --> 00:36:41,730
implication of that.

611
00:36:41,730 --> 00:36:46,880
That whole part of the
population is under sampled.

612
00:36:46,880 --> 00:36:49,370
There are lots of examples
of this.

613
00:36:49,370 --> 00:36:50,620
All right.

614
00:36:50,620 --> 00:36:53,190

615
00:36:53,190 --> 00:36:58,650
Moving along, another problem
we often see is data

616
00:36:58,650 --> 00:36:59,900
enhancement.

617
00:36:59,900 --> 00:37:06,570

618
00:37:06,570 --> 00:37:12,650
It's easy to read much more
into data than it actually

619
00:37:12,650 --> 00:37:16,070
implies, especially when
viewed out of context.

620
00:37:16,070 --> 00:37:23,090
So on April 29, 2009, CNN
reported that quote, "Mexican

621
00:37:23,090 --> 00:37:27,320
health officials suspect that
the swine flu outbreak has

622
00:37:27,320 --> 00:37:34,700
caused more than 159 deaths and
roughly 2,500 illnesses."

623
00:37:34,700 --> 00:37:38,360
It was pretty scary stuff at the
time, and people got all

624
00:37:38,360 --> 00:37:41,240
worried about the swine flu.

625
00:37:41,240 --> 00:37:45,730
On the other hand, how many
deaths a year do you think are

626
00:37:45,730 --> 00:37:48,260
attributable to the
conventional

627
00:37:48,260 --> 00:37:52,310
seasonal flu in the US?

628
00:37:52,310 --> 00:37:55,650
Anyone want to hazard a guess?

629
00:37:55,650 --> 00:37:58,550
36,000.

630
00:37:58,550 --> 00:38:01,750
So 36,000 people a year, on
average, will die from the

631
00:38:01,750 --> 00:38:06,920
seasonal flu, which sort of puts
in prospective that 159

632
00:38:06,920 --> 00:38:09,200
deaths from the swine flu
maybe shouldn't be so

633
00:38:09,200 --> 00:38:11,950
terrifying.

634
00:38:11,950 --> 00:38:17,210
But again, people typically did
not report both of those.

635
00:38:17,210 --> 00:38:21,890
Another great statistic, and
accurate, is that most auto

636
00:38:21,890 --> 00:38:26,030
accidents happen within
10 miles of home.

637
00:38:26,030 --> 00:38:28,880
I'm sure many of you
have heard that.

638
00:38:28,880 --> 00:38:31,290
So what does that mean?

639
00:38:31,290 --> 00:38:32,750
Almost nothing.

640
00:38:32,750 --> 00:38:35,270
Most driving is done
with 10 miles--

641
00:38:35,270 --> 00:38:37,780
within 10 miles of home.

642
00:38:37,780 --> 00:38:41,110
And besides that, what does
home mean in this context?

643
00:38:41,110 --> 00:38:44,000
What home means is
the registration

644
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:46,570
address of the car.

645
00:38:46,570 --> 00:38:52,150
So if I were to choose to
register my car in Alaska,

646
00:38:52,150 --> 00:38:54,500
does that mean I'm less likely
to have an accident driving

647
00:38:54,500 --> 00:38:56,190
around MIT?

648
00:38:56,190 --> 00:38:57,950
I don't think so.

649
00:38:57,950 --> 00:38:59,290
Again, it's a kind
of a meaningless.

650
00:38:59,290 --> 00:39:02,330

651
00:39:02,330 --> 00:39:04,560
Another aspect of this
is people often

652
00:39:04,560 --> 00:39:06,980
extrapolate from data.

653
00:39:06,980 --> 00:39:10,990
So we can look at an example
of internet usage.

654
00:39:10,990 --> 00:39:14,860
This is kind of a fun one too.

655
00:39:14,860 --> 00:39:18,860
So what I've plotted here is
the internet usage in the

656
00:39:18,860 --> 00:39:20,966
United states as a percentage
of population.

657
00:39:20,966 --> 00:39:34,400

658
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:36,740
And I plotted of this from--

659
00:39:36,740 --> 00:39:39,680
starting at 1994.

660
00:39:39,680 --> 00:39:43,820
And the green line, or actually,
the blue line there

661
00:39:43,820 --> 00:39:48,730
are the points and the green
line is a linear fit.

662
00:39:48,730 --> 00:39:52,050
If you looked at my code, you'd
see I was using polyfit

663
00:39:52,050 --> 00:39:56,860
with a 1 to get a line to fit,
and you can see it's a pretty

664
00:39:56,860 --> 00:39:59,850
darn good fit.

665
00:39:59,850 --> 00:40:02,860
So people actually looked at
these things and used this to

666
00:40:02,860 --> 00:40:08,860
extrapolate internet usage
going forward.

667
00:40:08,860 --> 00:40:10,110
So we can do that.

668
00:40:10,110 --> 00:40:13,380

669
00:40:13,380 --> 00:40:16,810
Now, we'll run the same
code with the

670
00:40:16,810 --> 00:40:18,400
extrapolation turned on.

671
00:40:18,400 --> 00:40:25,860

672
00:40:25,860 --> 00:40:29,350
And so figure (1) is the same
figure (1) as before, same

673
00:40:29,350 --> 00:40:31,120
data, same fit.

674
00:40:31,120 --> 00:40:33,140
And here's figure (2).

675
00:40:33,140 --> 00:40:38,000
And you'll notice that as of
last year about 115% of the US

676
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:44,450
population was using the
internet, probably not true.

677
00:40:44,450 --> 00:40:48,550
It may be possible in sports
to give 110%, but in

678
00:40:48,550 --> 00:40:49,800
statistics it's not.

679
00:40:49,800 --> 00:40:53,600

680
00:40:53,600 --> 00:40:56,510
Again, you see this all the
time when people are doing

681
00:40:56,510 --> 00:40:57,430
these projections.

682
00:40:57,430 --> 00:41:00,400
They'll say, fit some data,
they extrapolate into the

683
00:41:00,400 --> 00:41:03,930
future without understanding
why maybe that isn't a good

684
00:41:03,930 --> 00:41:05,410
thing to do.

685
00:41:05,410 --> 00:41:08,490
We saw that by when we were
modeling springs, right?

686
00:41:08,490 --> 00:41:12,620
We could accurately project
linearly until we exceeded the

687
00:41:12,620 --> 00:41:16,970
constant of elasticity at which
point our linear model

688
00:41:16,970 --> 00:41:19,510
was totally broken.

689
00:41:19,510 --> 00:41:22,320
So you always need to have some
reason other than just

690
00:41:22,320 --> 00:41:26,850
fitting the data to believe that
what you're doing makes

691
00:41:26,850 --> 00:41:30,230
actual sense.

692
00:41:30,230 --> 00:41:30,800
All right.

693
00:41:30,800 --> 00:41:37,240
The final one I want to talk
about is what is typically

694
00:41:37,240 --> 00:41:42,680
called in the literature the
Texas sharpshooter fallacy.

695
00:41:42,680 --> 00:41:57,360

696
00:41:57,360 --> 00:41:59,440
And this is a little bit tricky

697
00:41:59,440 --> 00:42:02,170
to understand sometimes.

698
00:42:02,170 --> 00:42:05,530
Actually, is there anyone
here from Texas?

699
00:42:05,530 --> 00:42:09,280
Oh good, so no one will
be offended by this.

700
00:42:09,280 --> 00:42:11,770
Well imagine that you're driving
down some country road

701
00:42:11,770 --> 00:42:15,990
in Texas and that
you see a barn.

702
00:42:15,990 --> 00:42:20,510
And that barn has six targets
painted on it, and in the dead

703
00:42:20,510 --> 00:42:25,650
center of each target, you
find a bullet hole.

704
00:42:25,650 --> 00:42:28,680
So you're driving, your pretty
impressed, and you stop.

705
00:42:28,680 --> 00:42:31,680
And you see the owner of the
barn and you say, you must be

706
00:42:31,680 --> 00:42:33,010
a damn good shot.

707
00:42:33,010 --> 00:42:36,280
And he says, absolutely,
I never miss.

708
00:42:36,280 --> 00:42:39,990
At which point the farmer's
wife walks out and says,

709
00:42:39,990 --> 00:42:43,370
that's right there ain't a man
in the state of Texas who is

710
00:42:43,370 --> 00:42:46,510
more accurate with
a paint gun.

711
00:42:46,510 --> 00:42:48,400
What did he do?

712
00:42:48,400 --> 00:42:51,840
He shot six bullets into
the barn, and he

713
00:42:51,840 --> 00:42:52,790
was a terrible shot.

714
00:42:52,790 --> 00:42:54,390
They were all over the place.

715
00:42:54,390 --> 00:42:56,635
Then he went and painted a
target around each of them.

716
00:42:56,635 --> 00:42:59,690

717
00:42:59,690 --> 00:43:03,000
And it looked like he
was a great shot.

718
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:05,880
Now you might think that, well
that's silly, no one would do

719
00:43:05,880 --> 00:43:07,500
that in practice.

720
00:43:07,500 --> 00:43:13,010
But in fact, it happens all
of the time in practice.

721
00:43:13,010 --> 00:43:17,500
A classic of this genre appeared
in the magazine New

722
00:43:17,500 --> 00:43:20,550
Scientist, in 2001.

723
00:43:20,550 --> 00:43:23,875
And it reported that a research
team led by John

724
00:43:23,875 --> 00:43:27,930
Eagles of the Royal Cornhill
Hospital in Aberdeen, had

725
00:43:27,930 --> 00:43:32,280
discovered that and I quote,
"Anorexic women are most

726
00:43:32,280 --> 00:43:35,780
likely to have been born in
the spring or early summer

727
00:43:35,780 --> 00:43:37,030
between March and June.

728
00:43:37,030 --> 00:43:39,220

729
00:43:39,220 --> 00:43:42,480
In fact, there were
more than--

730
00:43:42,480 --> 00:43:45,370
there were more than 13%--

731
00:43:45,370 --> 00:43:49,680
there were 13% more anorexics
born on average in those

732
00:43:49,680 --> 00:43:54,150
months, and 30% more anorexics,
on average, in

733
00:43:54,150 --> 00:43:57,870
June."

734
00:43:57,870 --> 00:44:01,100
Now, let's look at this
worrisome statistic.

735
00:44:01,100 --> 00:44:04,450
Are any of you women
here born in June?

736
00:44:04,450 --> 00:44:04,760
All right.

737
00:44:04,760 --> 00:44:08,630
Well, I won't ask about
your health history.

738
00:44:08,630 --> 00:44:11,740
But maybe you should be
worried, or maybe not.

739
00:44:11,740 --> 00:44:14,470
So let's look at how they
did this study.

740
00:44:14,470 --> 00:44:17,920
You may wonder why so many of
these studies are all studies

741
00:44:17,920 --> 00:44:19,300
about women's health.

742
00:44:19,300 --> 00:44:20,650
And then, perhaps, because
they're all

743
00:44:20,650 --> 00:44:22,760
done by male doctors.

744
00:44:22,760 --> 00:44:27,890
Anyway, the team studied 446
women who had been diagnosed

745
00:44:27,890 --> 00:44:29,140
as anorexic.

746
00:44:29,140 --> 00:44:31,110

747
00:44:31,110 --> 00:44:36,030
So if you divide that by 12
what you've discovered is

748
00:44:36,030 --> 00:44:42,660
that, on average, there should
have been 37 women born in

749
00:44:42,660 --> 00:44:48,130
each of those months,
of the 446.

750
00:44:48,130 --> 00:44:56,790
And in fact, in June, there were
48 anorexic women born.

751
00:44:56,790 --> 00:45:01,030
So they said, well, how likely
is this to have occurred

752
00:45:01,030 --> 00:45:02,280
simply by chance?

753
00:45:02,280 --> 00:45:05,030

754
00:45:05,030 --> 00:45:09,960
Well as I am want to do in
such occasions, I checked

755
00:45:09,960 --> 00:45:12,620
their analysis, and I
wrote a little piece

756
00:45:12,620 --> 00:45:15,660
of code to do that.

757
00:45:15,660 --> 00:45:19,390
So trying to figure out what's
the probability of 48 women

758
00:45:19,390 --> 00:45:23,870
being born in June, I ran
a simulation in which I

759
00:45:23,870 --> 00:45:30,700
simulated 446 births and chose
a month at random, and looked

760
00:45:30,700 --> 00:45:33,140
at the probability.

761
00:45:33,140 --> 00:45:35,900
And let's see what it
was when we run it.

762
00:45:35,900 --> 00:45:44,510

763
00:45:44,510 --> 00:45:46,120
Oops, well we didn't
want these graphs.

764
00:45:46,120 --> 00:45:49,360

765
00:45:49,360 --> 00:45:55,680
The probability of at least 48
births in June was 0.042.

766
00:45:55,680 --> 00:46:00,940
So in fact, pretty low.

767
00:46:00,940 --> 00:46:02,840
You might say, well, what's
the odds of this

768
00:46:02,840 --> 00:46:04,060
happening by accident?

769
00:46:04,060 --> 00:46:05,290
Pretty small.

770
00:46:05,290 --> 00:46:07,280
Therefore, maybe we are really
on to something.

771
00:46:07,280 --> 00:46:11,250
Maybe it has to do with the
conditions of the birth and

772
00:46:11,250 --> 00:46:14,050
the weather or who knows what.

773
00:46:14,050 --> 00:46:20,940
Well, what's wrong with
this analysis?

774
00:46:20,940 --> 00:46:24,890

775
00:46:24,890 --> 00:46:29,810
Well, one way to look at it is
this analysis would have been

776
00:46:29,810 --> 00:46:37,290
perfectly valid if the
researchers had started with a

777
00:46:37,290 --> 00:46:43,480
hypothesis that there are more
babies born in June than in

778
00:46:43,480 --> 00:46:46,890
any other month-- more future
anorexics born in June than in

779
00:46:46,890 --> 00:46:50,400
any other month, and then run
this experiment to test it,

780
00:46:50,400 --> 00:46:52,760
and validated it.

781
00:46:52,760 --> 00:46:58,130
So if they had started with the
hypothesis, and then from

782
00:46:58,130 --> 00:47:05,930
the hypothesis conducted what's
called a prospective

783
00:47:05,930 --> 00:47:16,750
study then they would have,
perhaps, valid reason to

784
00:47:16,750 --> 00:47:21,120
believe that the study supports
the hypothesis.

785
00:47:21,120 --> 00:47:24,790
But that's not what they did.

786
00:47:24,790 --> 00:47:28,440
Instead what they did is they
looked at the data and then

787
00:47:28,440 --> 00:47:33,300
chose a hypothesis that matched
the data, the Texas

788
00:47:33,300 --> 00:47:36,600
sharpshooter fallacy.

789
00:47:36,600 --> 00:47:40,600
Given that that was the
experiment they performed, the

790
00:47:40,600 --> 00:47:45,070
right question to ask is not
what is the probability that

791
00:47:45,070 --> 00:47:50,770
you had 48 future anorexics born
in June, but what was the

792
00:47:50,770 --> 00:47:56,170
probability that you have 48
future anorexics born in at

793
00:47:56,170 --> 00:47:59,400
least one of the 12 months?

794
00:47:59,400 --> 00:48:03,020
Because that's what they were
really doing, right?

795
00:48:03,020 --> 00:48:10,670
So therefore, we should really
have run this simulation.

796
00:48:10,670 --> 00:48:14,030
Similar to the previous one,
again, these are in your hand

797
00:48:14,030 --> 00:48:22,750
out, but is there at least
one month in which

798
00:48:22,750 --> 00:48:26,034
there were 48 births?

799
00:48:26,034 --> 00:48:33,100
And if we run that we'll see
that the probability is over

800
00:48:33,100 --> 00:48:38,820
40%, not so impressive as 4%.

801
00:48:38,820 --> 00:48:43,560
So in fact, we see that we
probably shouldn't draw any

802
00:48:43,560 --> 00:48:44,980
conclusion.

803
00:48:44,980 --> 00:48:47,600
The probability of this
happening by pure accident is

804
00:48:47,600 --> 00:48:50,090
almost 50%.

805
00:48:50,090 --> 00:48:56,030
So why should we believe that
it's somehow meaningful.

806
00:48:56,030 --> 00:49:01,030
Again, an example of the Texas
sharpshooter fallacy that

807
00:49:01,030 --> 00:49:04,400
appeared in the literature and
a lot of people fell for it.

808
00:49:04,400 --> 00:49:06,840
And if we had more time, I
would give you many more

809
00:49:06,840 --> 00:49:08,970
examples, but we don't.

810
00:49:08,970 --> 00:49:13,980
I'll see you on Thursday,
on Tuesday, rather.

811
00:49:13,980 --> 00:49:15,140
Two more lectures to go.

812
00:49:15,140 --> 00:49:19,300
On Tuesday, I'm going to go over
some code that I'll be

813
00:49:19,300 --> 00:49:20,900
asking you to look
at in preparation

814
00:49:20,900 --> 00:49:22,860
for the final exam.

815
00:49:22,860 --> 00:49:25,510
And then on Thursday, we'll
wrap things up.

816
00:49:25,510 --> 00:49:35,317
